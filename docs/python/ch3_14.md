# Inheritance: For Better of for Worse

- multiple inheritance is supported in C++, Java but not C#. After percieved abuse in early C++ codebases, Java left it out.
- there is significant backlash against overuse of inheritance, multiple inheritance (worse), because superclasses and subclasses are tightly coupled.
- after all this bad name, its(multiple inheritance) still usefull in many practical scenarios, like in standard library, Django, Tkinter GUI toolkit.

## The super() Function

- consistent use of the `super()` built-in function is essential for maintainable object-oriented Python programs.
- when subclass method overrides a method of a superclass, the overriding method usually needs to call the corresponding method of superclass.

````python
class LastUpdatedOrderedDict(OrderedDict):
    """Store items in the order they were last updated"""

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
        self.move_to_end(key)
````

````python
def __init__(self, a, b):
  super().__init__(a,b)
  ... # more init code
````

- there are few examples where overriding method doesn’t use `super()` but instead call method directly as `OrderedDict.__setitem__(self, key, value)`. This is not recommended for reasons
  - hardcoding base class name
  - `super` implements logic to handle class hierarchies with multiple inheritance.

### Subclassing Built-In Types Is Tricky

- earlier versions of python didn’t support subclassing built-ins (most are implemented in C) usually doesn’t call methods overridden by user-defined classes.
- From official documentation:
  - CPython has no rule at all for when exactly overridden method of subclasses of built-in types get implicitly called or not. As an approximation, these methods are never called by other built-in methods of the same object. For example, an overridden `__getitem__()` in a subclass of `dict` will not be called by e.g. the built-in `get()` method.

````python
class DoppelDict(dict):
  def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    super().__setitem__(key, [value] * 2)		# duplicate values when storing

dd = DoppelDict(one = 1)	# constructor ignores __setitem__
dd	# {'one': 1}
dd['two'] = 2	# [] operator works
dd  # {'one': 1, 'two': [2,2]}
dd.update(three = 3)	# update doesn't work expected
dd	# {'three': 3, 'one' : 1, 'two':[2,2]}
````

- The built-in behaviour is a violation of a basic rule of OOP: the search for methods should always start from class of the receiver(`self`), even when the call happens inside a method implemented in a superclass. This is what is called `late binding` which is a key feature of OOP. In any call of form `x.method()` the exact method to be called must be determined at runtime, based on class of receiver `x`.
- The problem is not limited to calls within an instance—whether `self.get()` calls `self.__getitem__()`—but also happens with overridden methods of other classes that should be called by the built-in methods.

````python
class AnswerDict(dict):
  def __getitem__(self, key):	# always return 42
    return 42
  
ad = AnswerDict(a = 'foo')	# loaded with (a='foo')
ad['a']	# 42	# expected
d = {}
d.update(ad)	# update normal dict d, updated with ad
d['a']	# 'foo'	# but our `dict.update` ignored our original AnswerDict method
d			# {'a':'foo'}
````

Subclassing built-in types like `dict` or `list` or `str` directly is error-prone because the built-in methods mostly ignore  user-defined overrides. Instead of subclassing the built-ins, derive  your classes from the [`collections`](https://fpy.li/14-6) module using `UserDict`, `UserList`, and `UserString`, which are designed to be easily  extended.

## Multiple Inheritance and Method Resolution Order

- Any language which implements multiple inheritance has to deal with naming conflicts when superclass implement a method by the same name, commonly known as diamond problem.

![UML for diamond problem](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492056348/files/assets/flpy_1401.png)

Assume following implementation

````python
class Root:
  	def ping(self):
        print(f'{self}.ping() in Root')

    def pong(self):
        print(f'{self}.pong() in Root')

    def __repr__(self):
        cls_name = type(self).__name__
        return f'<instance of {cls_name}>'

class A(Root):
    def ping(self):
        print(f'{self}.ping() in A')
        super().ping()

    def pong(self):
        print(f'{self}.pong() in A')
        super().pong()

class B(Root):
    def ping(self):
        print(f'{self}.ping() in B')
        super().ping()

    def pong(self):
        print(f'{self}.pong() in B')

class Leaf(A, B):
    def ping(self):
        print(f'{self}.ping() in Leaf')
        super().ping()
````

````python
leaf1 = Leaf()
leaf1.ping()

#
#    <instance of Leaf>.ping() in Leaf
#    <instance of Leaf>.ping() in A
#    <instance of Leaf>.ping() in B
#    <instance of Leaf>.ping() in Root

leaf1.pong()

#    <instance of Leaf>.pong() in A
#    <instance of Leaf>.pong() in B
````

Lets take a look at MRO of the class to find references to its superclasses

````python
Leaf.__mro__  # doctest:+NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    (<class 'diamond1.Leaf'>, <class 'diamond1.A'>, <class 'diamond1.B'>,
     <class 'diamond1.Root'>, <class 'object'>)
````

- MRO only determines activation order, but when particular method will be activated in each of the classes depend on whether each implementation calls `super()` or not.

- In `pong` method. The `Leaf` doesn’t override it, therefore activated implementation of next class `Leaf.__mro__` : the A class. Since method `A.pong` calls `super().pong()`. The `B` class is next in MRO, therefore `B.pong` is activated but method doesn’t calls `super.pong()` so activation stops.
- NOTE: declaration `Leaf(A,B)` and `Leaf(B, A)` are separate and determine relative order in MRO.
- when a method calls `super()`, it is a cooperative method. Cooperative methods enable *cooperative multiple inheritance*. These terms are intension in order to work, multiple inheritance in Python requires cooperation of the methods involved. In the `B` class, `ping` cooperates but `pong` doesn’t.
- Python is a dynamic language, so the interaction of `super()` with the MRO is also dynamic.

````python
from diamond import A
class U():
  def ping(self):
    print(f'{self}.ping() in U')
    super().ping()
    
class LeafUA(U, A):
  def ping(self):
    print(f'{self}.ping() in LeafUA')
    super().ping()

````

````python
u = U()
u.ping()
# AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'ping'
# because notice U doesn't inherit any class except object, which doesn't implement ping

leaf2 = LeafUA()	# this works as MRO works fine, last Root class doesn't call super ending MRO traversal
````

- Classes like U are called as mixin class. Its a class intended to be used together with other cleasses in multiple inheritance, to provide additional functionality.

## Mixin Classes

A mixin class is designed to be subclassed together with at least one other class in a multiple inheritance arrangement. 

- A mixin is not supposed to be only base class of a concrete class, because it doesn’t provide all the functionality for a concrete class.
- only add/customizes the behaviour of child or sibling class.

### Case-Insesitive Mappings

````python
import collections

def _upper(key):	# helper function
    try:
        return key.upper()
    except AttributeError:
        return key

class UpperCaseMixin: # mixin implement 4 essential methods of mappings, always calling `super()` with the `key` uppercased
    def __setitem__(self, key, item):
        super().__setitem__(_upper(key), item)

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return super().__getitem__(_upper(key))

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        return super().get(_upper(key), default)

    def __contains__(self, key):
        return super().__contains__(_upper(key))
````

````python
# Concrete Classes using above Mixin
class UpperDict(UpperCaseMixin, collections.UserDict): # UserDict
    pass

class UpperCounter(UpperCaseMixin, collections.Counter): # Counter
    """Specialized 'Counter' that uppercases string keys"""
````

````python
d = UpperDict([('a', 'letter A'), (2, 'digit two')])
list(d.keys()) # ['A', 2]
d['b'] = 'letter B'
'b' in d	# true
list(d.keys())	# ['A', 2, 'B']
````

## Multiple Inheritance in the Real World

- In Design Patterns book, almost all code is in C++, but the only example of multiple inheritance is the Adapter Pattern, In python, multiple inhertance is not the norm either but there are important examples.

### ABCs Are Mixins Too

- documentation of `collection.abc` uses the term *mixin method* for the concrete methods implemented in many of the collection ABCs.
- The ABCs that provide mixin methods play two roles
  - Interface definitions
  - Mixin Classes

### ThreadingMixIn and ForkingMixIn

The `http.server` package provides `HTTPServer` and `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Latter was added in 3.7+, is identical to `HTTPServer` but uses threads to handle requests by using the `ThreadingMixIn`. This is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which `HTTPServer` would wait indefinitely

Complete Source Code for it is

````python
class ThreadingHTTPServer(socketserver.ThreadingMixin, HTTPServer)
	daemon_threads = True
````

### Django Generic Views Mixins

- In Django, a view is a callable object that takes a `request` argument—an object representing an HTTP request—and returns an object representing an HTTP response.

- `View` is the base class of all views (it could be an ABC), and it provides core functionality like the `dispatch` method, which delegates to “handler” methods like `get`, `head`, `post`, etc., implemented by concrete subclasses to handle the different HTTP verbs. The `RedirectView` class inherits only from `View`, and you can see that it implements `get`, `head`, `post`, etc.

### Multiple Inheritance in Tkinter

- Extreme example of multiple inheritance is Python’s standard library, Tkinter GUI Toolkit.
- By current standards, the class hierarchy of Tkinter is very deep. Few parts of the Python standard library have more than three or four levels of concrete classes, and the same can be said of the Java class library. However, it is interesting to note that the some of the deepest hierarchies in the Java class library are precisely in  the packages related to GUI programming:

## Coping with Inheritance

What Alan Kay wrote in the epigraph remains true: there’s still no general theory about inheritance that can guide practicing programmers. What we have are rules of thumb, design patterns, “best practices,” clever acronyms, taboos, etc. Some of these provide useful guidelines, but none of them are universally accepted or always  applicable.

here are a few tips to avoid spaghetti class graphs.

### Favor Object Composition over Class Inheritance

- second principle of object-oriented design from the *Design Patterns* book
- Favoring composition leads to more flexible designs.
- Composition and delegation can replace the use of mixins to make behaviors available to different classes, but cannot replace the use of interface inheritance to define a hierarchy of types.

### Understand Why Inheritance is Used in Each Case

- When dealing with multiple inheritance, it’s useful to keep straight  the reasons why subclassing is done in each particular case. The main reasons are:
  - Inheritance of interface creates a subtype, implying an “is-a” relationship. This is best done with ABCs.
    - **Example**: Consider a scenario where you have a base class `Shape`, and you want to create specific shapes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Each shape must implement certain methods like `area()` and `perimeter()`. In this case, `Shape` can be an abstract base class defining these methods, and `Circle` and `Rectangle` can be concrete subclasses implementing these methods.
  - Inheritance of implementation avoids code duplication by reuse. Mixins can help with this.
    - Suppose you have multiple classes (`A`, `B`, `C`) that need logging functionality. Instead of duplicating logging code in each class, you can create a mixin class `LogMixin` that contains the logging functionality. Then, you can inherit from `LogMixin` in each class that needs logging capabilities.

### Make Interface Explicit with ABCs

In modern Python, if a class is intended to define an interface, it should be an explicit ABC or a `typing.Protocol` subclass. An ABC should subclass only `abc.ABC` or other ABCs. Multiple inheritance of ABCs is not problematic.

### Use Explicit Mixins for Code Reuse

If a class is designed to provide method implementations for reuse by multiple unrelated subclasses, without implying an “is-a” relationship, it should be an explicit *mixin class*. Conceptually, a mixin does not define a new type; it merely bundles methods for reuse. A mixin should never be instantiated, and concrete classes should not inherit only from a mixin. Each mixin should provide a single specific behavior, implementing few and very closely related methods. Mixins should avoid keeping any internal state; i.e., a mixin class should not have instance attributes.

- There is no formal way in Python to state that a class is a mixin, so it is highly recommended that they are named with a `Mixin` suffix.

### Provide Aggregate Classes to Users

A class that is constructed primarily by inheriting from mixins and does not add its own structure or behavior is called an *aggregate class*.

If some combination of ABCs or mixins is particularly useful to client code, provide a class that brings them together in a sensible way.

### Subclass Only Classes Designed for Subclassing

Subclassing any complex class and overriding its methods is error-prone because the superclass methods may ignore the subclass overrides in unexpected ways. As much as possible, avoid overriding methods, or at least restrain yourself to subclassing classes which are designed to be easily extended, and only in the ways in which they were designed to be extended.



he PEP introduces a [`@final`](https://fpy.li/14-34) decorator that can be applied to classes or individual methods, so that IDEs or type checkers can report misguided attempts to subclass those classes or override those methods.

### Avoid Subclassing from Concrete Classes

Subclassing concrete classes is more dangerous than subclassing ABCs and mixins, because instances of concrete classes usually have internal state that can easily be corrupted when you override methods that depend on that state. Even if your methods cooperate by calling `super()`, and the internal state is held in private attributes using the `__x` syntax, there are still countless ways a method override can introduce bugs.

### Tkinter: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Most advice in the previous section is not followed by Tkinter, with the notable exception of “Provide Aggregate Classes to Users”.

Keep in mind that Tkinter has been part of the standard library since Python 1.1 was released in 1994. Tkinter is a layer on top of the excellent Tk GUI toolkit of the Tcl language. The Tcl/Tk combo is not originally object-oriented, so the Tk API is basically a vast catalog of functions. However, the toolkit is object-oriented in its design, if not in its original Tcl implementation.

To be fair, as a Tkinter user, you don’t need to know or use multiple  inheritance at all. It’s an implementation detail hidden behind the  widget classes that you will instantiate or subclass in your own code.  But you will suffer the consequences of excessive multiple inheritance  when you type `dir(tkinter.Button)` and try to find the method you need among the 214 attributes listed. And you’ll need to face the complexity if you decide to implement a new Tk widget.
