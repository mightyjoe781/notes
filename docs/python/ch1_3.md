# Dictionaries and Sets

- `dict` type is a fundamental part of python’s implementation.
- Highly optimized using hash tables, other built-in types based on hash-tables are `set` and `frozenset` offering richer APIs and operators.

## Modern dict Syntax

### dict Comprehensions (`dictcomp`)

````python
dial_codes = [(91, 'India'), (1, 'United States')]
country_dial = {country: code for code, country in dial_codes}
country_dial["India"] # 91
country_codes = {code: country.upper() for country, code in sorted(country_dial.items()) if code < 70}
````

### Unpacking Mappings

- We can apply `**` to more than one argument in function calls. This works when keys are all strings and unique across all arguments (**NOTE: Duplicate keyword arguments are forbidden**)

````python
def dump(**kwargs):
  return kwargs

# dump(**{'x':1, y = 2, **{'z':3}})
# {'x':1, 'y':2, 'z':3}

# example 2
# {'a': 0, **{'x': 1}, 'y': 2, **{'z': 3, 'x': 4}}
# {'a': 0, 'x': 4, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}
````

NOTE: in case of duplicate args are overwritten by later occurances.

### Merge Mappings with |

````python
d1 = {'a':1, 'b':3}
d2 = {'a':2, 'b':4, 'c':6}
# notice overwritten keys by later set
d1|d2	# {'a': 2, 'b': 4, 'c': 6}
````

## Pattern Matching with Mappings

- Similar to sequence based pattern matching

````python
def get_creators(record: dict)->list:
  match record:
    case {'type':'book', 'api':2, 'authors':[*names]}:
      return names
    case {'type':'book', 'api':1, 'author': name}:
      return [name]
    case {'type':'book'}:
      raise ValueError(f"Invalid 'book' record:{record!r}")
    case {'type': 'movie', 'director':name}:
      return [name]
    case _:
      raise ValueError(f"Invalid Record: {record!r}")  
````

- We can handle semi-structured data like JSON records

````python
from collection import OrderedDict
b1 = dict(api=1, author'Temp Book', type='book', title='unknown')
get_creators(b1)	# ['unknown']
b2 = OrderedDict(api=2, type='book', title='Mystery of Python', authors:'smk hmk vib'.split())	
get_creators(b2) # ['smk', 'hmk', 'vib']

# notice how order doesn't matter, only keys need to be present correctly

````

## Standard API of Mapping Types

![UML class diagram for `Mapping` and `MutableMapping`](https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781492056348/files/assets/flpy_0301.png)

- To implement a custom mapping, its easier to exten `collections.UserDict`, or to wrap a `dict` by composition, instead of subclassing these ABCs.
- Note : only limitation to this is Keys must be Hashable

### What is Hashable

- An object is hashable if it has a hash code which never changes during its lifetime and can be compared to other objects.
- Implements : `__hash__()` and `__eq__()`

### Inserting or Updating Mutable Values

- following python’s *fail-fast* policy, `dict` access with `d[k]` raises an error when `k` doesn’t exist. Many folks know to use `d.get(k, default)` instead of handling `KeyError`. However to retrieve mutable value and update it, there is a better way.

````python
# example from zen of python
# we calculate occurances of a word and store it in dict (k,v) : (string, List[int])
# skipped irrelevant code
occ = index.get(word, [])	# search dict if the word exists or not
occ.append(location)	# update the list
index[word] = occ		# reassigned the dict key

# A better approach to this is using one line
index.setdefault(word, []).append(location)	# get the key or set the default empty then append

# basically we improved the code
if key not in my_dict:
  my_dict[key] = []
my_dict[key].append(new_value)
# to
my_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(new_value)
````

## Automatic Handling of Missing Keys

- If we want our `dict` to handle missing keys and return some specific value then we can either use `defaultdict` or subclass `dict` or any other mapping and populate `__missing__` method.

````python
# above code can be fixed now as
index = collections.defaultdict(list)	# calls list() function for deafult value
# now code doesn't need to check for missing keys
````

- Another example : `StrKeyDict0` class that converts nonstring keys to `str` on lookup

````python
class StrKeyDict0(dict):
  def __missing__(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, str):	# if key is already a string, return KeyError (imp as prevents recursion)
      raise KeyError(key)
    return self[str(key)]			# build key into string and search (prevent recursion here)
  def get(self, key, default=None):
    try:
      return self[key]	# --> calls `__getitem__` -> calls __missing__
    except KeyError:
      return default
  def __contains__(self, key):
    return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()	# search unmodified key or its string representation, requires because vanilla contains doesn't falls back to __missing__
````

NOTE: its much better to subclass `UserDict` than `dict`. Above example is bad :)

## Variation of Dict

#### collections.OrderedDict

- NOTE: built-in `dict` also keeps keys ordered, mostly its used due to backward compatibility. Some reasons for using it from python documentation
- The equality operation for `OrderedDict` check for matching order
- `popitem()` method for `OrderedDict` has a different signature and accepts optional argument to specify which item is popped.
- `move_to_end()` method to efficiently reposition element to endpoint
- `OrderedDict` can handle frequent reordering operation better than `dict`. Suitable for tracking recent accesses (LRU Cache)

NOTE: dict was designed primarily for fast access, maintaing order is secondary while Ordered dict was designed for reordering operations.

#### collections.ChainMap

`ChainMap` instance holds a list of mappings that can be searched as one. The lookup is performed on each input mapping in the order it appears in constructor call. returns as soon as key is found in one of those mappings.

````python
d1 = dict(a=1, b= 3)
d2 = dict(a=2, b= 4, c=6)
from collection import ChainMap
chain = ChainMap(d1, d2)
chain['a']	# output 1
chain['a']	# output 6
````

- ChainMap instance doesn’t copy input mapping but holds references to them. Updates or insertions affect first input mapping only.

````python
chain['a'] = -1		# changes on d1
````

NOTE: Its mostly used for implementing interpreters for languages with nested scopes, where each mapping represents a scope context.

````python
import builtins
pylookup = ChainMap(locals(), globals(), vars(builtins))
````

#### collections.Counter

A mapping that holds an integer for each key. Updating an existing key adds to its count. This is used for count instances of hashable objects or as a multiset/ `Counter` implements `+` and `-` operators to combine tallies and provides useful methods such as `most_common[n]` return most commonly updated items and their count.

````python
ct = collections.Counter('abracadabra')
ct	 	# Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'r': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})
ct.update('aaaaazzz')
ct		# Counter({'a': 10, 'z': 3, 'b': 2, 'r': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1})
ct.most_common(3)	# [('a', 10), ('z', 3), ('b', 2)]
````

#### shelve.Shelf

`shelve` module in the standard library provides persistent storage for a mapping of string keys to Python Objects serialized in the pickle binary format.

The `shelve.open` module-level fucntion returns a `sheve.Shelf` instance - a simple key-value DBM Database backed by `dbm` module, with following properties

- `shelve.Shelf` subclasses `abc.MutableMapping`, so it provides the essential methods we expect of a mapping type.
- In addition, `shelve.Shelf` provides a few other I/O management methods, like `sync` and `close`.
- A `Shelf` instance is a context manager, so you can use a `with` block to make sure it is closed after use.
- Keys and values are saved whenever a new value is assigned to a key.
- The keys must be strings.
- The values must be objects that the `pickle` module can serialize.

### Subclassing UserDict instead of dict

- built-in has implementation shortcuts that end up forcing us to override methods that we can just inherit from `UserDict` with no problems.
- NOTE: `UserDict` doesn’t inherit from `dict` but uses composition : internal `dict` instance called `data` which holds the actual items. This avoids undesired recursion when coding special methods like `__setitem__` and simplifies the coding of `__contains__`

````python
import collections
class StrKeyDict(collections.UserDict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]
    def __contains__(self, key):
        return str(key) in self.data

    def __setitem__(self, key, item):
        self.data[str(key)] = item
````

## Immutable Mappings

- All standard library mappings are mutable, but we may need to prevent users from changing mapping by accident.
- Use cases in hardware programming library (Pingo) the board.pins maps represent physical GPIO ings on device, requires that user don’t change them
- `types` module provides a wrapper class called `MappingProxyType` which, given a mapping returns a `mappingproxy` instance that is read only but `dynamic proxy` for the original mapping. Meaning we can update dynamicproxy and see changes in mapping proxy but we can’t update mapping proxy.

````python
from types import MappingProxyType
d = {1: 'A'}
d_proxy = MappingProxyType(d)	# mappingproxy({1: 'A'})
d_proxy[1] 	# output : 'A'
d_proxy[2] = 'x'	# doesn't support assignment error
d[2] = 'B'
d_proxy # mappingproxy({1: 'A', 2: 'B'})
d_proxy[2]	# output : 'B'
````

## Dictionary Views

The `dict` instance methods `.keys()`, `.values()` and `.items()` return instances of classes called `dict_keys`, `dict_values` and `dict_items`. These dictionary views are read-only projection of internal data structures used in `dict` implementation.

- Avoids memory overhead or equivalent python2 methods that returned lists duplicating data already in the target `dict` and they also replace old methods that returned iterators.

````python
d = dict(a=10, b=20, c=30)
values = d.values()
values # dict_values([10, 20, 30])  1
len(values)  # 3
list(values) # convert into list, as views are iterable [10, 20, 30]
reversed(values) # <dict_reversevalueiterator object at 0x10e9e7310>
values[0]	# we cannot update these views
# Traceback (most recent call last):
  # File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: 'dict_values' object is not subscriptable
````

- A view object is a dynamic proxy. If source `dict` is updated you can immidediately see changes through an existing views.

## Practical Consequences of How dict Works

The hash table implementation of Python’s `dict` is very efficient, but it’s important to understand the practical effects of this design:

- Keys must be hashable objects. They must implement proper `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods.
- Item access by key is very fast. A `dict` may have  millions of keys, but Python can locate a key directly by computing the  hash code of the key and deriving an index offset into the hash table,  with the possible overhead of a small number of tries to find a matching entry.
- Key ordering is preserved as a side effect of a more compact memory layout for `dict` in CPython 3.6, which became an official language feature in 3.7.
- Despite its new compact layout, dicts inevitably have a significant  memory overhead. The most compact internal data structure for a  container would be an array of pointers to the items.[8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/ch03.html#idm46582498236432) Compared to that, a hash table needs to store more data per entry, and  Python needs to keep at least one-third of the hash table rows empty to  remain efficient.
- To save memory, avoid creating instance attributes outside of the `__init__` method.

## Set Theory

NOTE: `set` is mutable while its sibling `frozenset` is immutable

- A set is a collection of unique objects
- set elements must be hashable. The `set` type is not hashable, so you can’t build a `set` with nested `set`. But `frozenset` is hashable so we can have it inside `set`
- set supports multiple infix operators like
  - `a | b` union
  - `a & b` intersection
  - `a - b` difference
  - `a^b` symmetric difference

````python
l = ['spam', 'spam', 'bacon', 'eggs', 'eggs']
set(l) # {'spam', 'bacon', 'eggs'}
list(set(l))	# remove duplicates from a list
````

````python
# NOTE : unrelated
# remove duplicates but also preserve order of first occurence of each items, we can use plain dict
dict.fromkeys(l).keys()
# dict_keys(['spam','eggs', 'bacon'])
list(dict.fromkeys(l).keys())
````

````python
# count occurrences of needles in a haystack, both of type set
found = len(needles & haystack)
````

### Set Literals

- NOTE: there is no representation for empty set : use `set()` because `{}` already declares an empty dict
- NOTE: `st = {1, 2, 3}` is much faster than `st = set([1, 2, 3])`.
- There is no syntax to represent `frozenset` so we have to use constructor like this `frozenset(range(10))`

### Set Comprehensions

````python
from unicodedata import name
# set of Latin-1 characters that have sign in their unicode names
{chr(i) for i in range(32, 256) if 'SIGN' in name(chr(i), '')}
````

## Practical Consequences of How set Works

`set` and `frozenset` are both implemented with a hash table with following effects.

- set elements must be hashable. They must implement proper `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods.
- Membership testing is very efficient
- sets have significant memory overhead compared to low-level array pointers to its elements
- element ordering depends on insertion order but not in a useful or reliable way.
- adding elements to a set ma change order of existing elements. Because algorithm becomes less efficient if the hash table is more than two-thirds full, so python may need to move and resize table as it grows.
