# Operator Overloading

Operator overloading is necessary to support infix operator notation with user-defined or extension types, such as NumPy arrays. Having operator overloading in a high-level, easy-to-use language was probably a key reason for the huge success of Python in data science, including financial and scientific applications.

## Operator Overloading 101

- allows user-defined objects to interoperate with infix operator like `+` and `|` or unary operators like `-` and `~`. More generally function invocation (`()`), attribute access (`.`), and items-access/slicing `[]` are also operators in python.
- This chapter deals with unary and infix operators
- Python strikes a good balance among flexibility, usability, and safety by imposing some limitations:
  - We cannot change the meaning of the operators for the built-in types.
  - We cannot create new operators, only overload existing ones.
  - A few operators can’t be overloaded: `is`, `and`, `or`, `not` (but the bitwise `&`, `|`, `~`, can).

## Unary Operators

- `-`, implemented by `__neg__`
- `+`, implemented by `__add__`
- `~`, implemented by `__invert__`

The “Data Model” chapter of The Python Language Reference also lists the `abs()` built-in function as a unary operator. The associated special method is `__abs__`, as we’ve seen before.

- its simple to support Unary Operators just implement the supporting function
- Follow only one rule, always return a new objects of suitable types, don’t modify the receiver `self`.

For `+`/`-` usually returned object would be of same type but for `~` its depends on context. `abs` will return scalar always.

````python
    def __abs__(self):
        return math.hypot(*self)

    def __neg__(self):
        return Vector(-x for x in self)

    def __pos__(self):
        return Vector(self)
````

Everybody expects that `x == +x`, and that is true almost all the time in Python, but there are two cases in the standard library where `x != +x`.

The first case involves the `decimal.Decimal` class. You can have `x != +x` if `x` is a `Decimal` instance created in an arithmetic context and `+x` is then evaluated in a context with different settings.

You can find the second case where x != +x in the `collections.Counter` documentation. The `Counter` class implements several arithmetic operators, including infix `+` to add the tallies from two `Counter` instances.

However, for practical reasons, `Counter` addition discards from the result any item with a negative or zero count. And the prefix `+` is a shortcut for adding an empty `Counter`, therefore it produces a new `Counter`, preserving only the tallies that are greater than zero.

````python
ct = Counter('abracadabra')
ct # Counter({'a': 5, 'r': 2, 'b': 2, 'd': 1, 'c': 1})
ct['r'] = -3
ct['d'] = 0
ct # Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 0, 'r': -3})
+ct # Counter({'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})
````

## Overloading + for Vector Addition

Adding two Euclidean vectors results in a new vector in which the components are the pairwise additions of the components of the operands.

What happens if we try to add two `Vector` instances of  different lengths? We could raise an error, but considering practical  applications (such as information retrieval), it’s better to fill out  the shortest `Vector` with zeros.

````python
    # inside the Vector class

    def __add__(self, other):
        pairs = itertools.zip_longest(self, other, fillvalue=0.0) # generator that produces tuples (a, b) where a is from self, and b. If self and other has different lenghts, fillvalue supplies the missing values for the shortes iterable.
        return Vector(a + b for a, b in pairs)	# built from a generator expression, producing one addition for each (a,b) from pairs
````

````python
v1 = Vector([3, 4, 5])
v1 + (10, 20, 30)	# works because zip_longest consumes any iterable
(10,20, 30) + v1	# fails because tuple doesn't implement our __add__ implementation
````

Python implements a special dispatching mechanism for the infix operator special methods. Given an expression `a + b`, the interpreter will perform these steps

- If `a` has `__add__`, call `a.__add__(b)` and return result unless it’s `NotImplemented`.
- If `a` doesn’t have `__add__`, or calling it returns `NotImplemented`, check if `b` has `__radd__`, then call `b.__radd__(a)` and return result unless it’s `NotImplemented`.
- If `b` doesn’t have `__radd__`, or calling it returns `NotImplemented`, raise `TypeError` with an *unsupported operand types* message.

> Do not confuse `NotImplemented` with `NotImplementedError`. The first, `NotImplemented`, is a special singleton value that an infix operator special method should `return` to tell the interpreter it cannot handle a given operand. In contrast, `NotImplementedError` is an exception that stub methods in abstract classes may `raise` to warn that subclasses must implement them.

````python
    # inside the Vector class

    def __add__(self, other):
        pairs = itertools.zip_longest(self, other, fillvalue=0.0)
        return Vector(a + b for a, b in pairs)

    def __radd__(self, other): # more simple implementation
        return self + other
````

Often, `__radd__` can be as simple as that: just invoke the proper operator, therefore delegating to `__add__` in this case. This applies to any commutative operator; `+` is commutative when dealing with numbers or our vectors, but it’s not commutative when concatenating sequences in Python.

````python
    def __add__(self, other):
        pairs = itertools.zip_longest(self, other, fillvalue=0.0)
        return Vector(a + b for a, b in pairs)

    __radd__ = __add__
````

if an operator special method cannot return a valid result because of type incompatibility, it should return `NotImplemented` and not raise `TypeError`. By returning `NotImplemented`, you leave the door open for the implementer of the other operand type  to perform the operation when Python tries the reversed method call.

In the spirit of duck typing, we will refrain from testing the type of the `other` operand, or the type of its elements. We’ll catch the exceptions and return `NotImplemented`. If the interpreter has not yet reversed the operands, it will try that. If the reverse method call returns `NotImplemented`, then Python will raise `TypeError` with a standard error message like “unsupported operand type(s) for +: *Vector* and *str*.”

````python
    def __add__(self, other):
        try:
            pairs = itertools.zip_longest(self, other, fillvalue=0.0)
            return Vector(a + b for a, b in pairs)
        except TypeError:
            return NotImplemented

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self + other
````

## Overloading * for Scalar Multiplication

What does `Vector([1, 2, 3]) * x` mean? If `x` is a number, that would be a scalar product, and the result would be a new `Vector` with each component multiplied by `x`—also known as an elementwise multiplication:

Back to our scalar product, again we start with the simplest `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods that could possibly work:

````python
    # inside the Vector class

    def __mul__(self, scalar):
        return Vector(n * scalar for n in self)

    def __rmul__(self, scalar):
        return self * scalar
````

Those methods do work, except when provided with incompatible operands. The `scalar` argument has to be a number that when multiplied by a `float` produces another `float` (because our `Vector` class uses an `array` of floats internally). So a `complex` number will not do, but the scalar can be an `int`, a `bool` (because `bool` is a subclass of `int`), or even a `fractions.Fraction` instance.

````python
class Vector:
    typecode = 'd'

    def __init__(self, components):
        self._components = array(self.typecode, components)

    # many methods omitted in book listing, see vector_v7.py
    # in https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e

    def __mul__(self, scalar):
        try:
            factor = float(scalar)
        except TypeError: # scalar can't be converted to float
            return NotImplemented
        return Vector(n * factor for n in self)

    def __rmul__(self, scalar):
        return self * scalar
````

## Using @ as an Infix Operator

The `@` sign is well-known as the prefix of function decorators, but since 2015, it can also be used as an infix operator. For years, the dot product was written as `numpy.dot(a, b)` in NumPy.(3.5+)

Today, you can write `a @ b` to compute the dot product of two NumPy arrays.

The `@` operator is supported by the special methods `__matmul__`, `__rmatmul__`, and `__imatmul__`, named for “matrix multiplication.” These methods are not used anywhere in the standard library at this time, but are recognized by the interpreter since Python 3.5, so the NumPy team—and the rest of us—can support the `@` operator in user-defined types. The parser was also changed to handle the new operator (`a @ b` was a syntax error in Python 3.4).

````python
class Vector:
    # many methods omitted in book listing

    def __matmul__(self, other):
        if (isinstance(other, abc.Sized) and # both should implement __len__ & __iter__
            isinstance(other, abc.Iterable)):
            if len(self) == len(other): # have same length to allow
                return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(self, other)) # using zip and sum operations
            else:
                raise ValueError('@ requires vectors of equal length.')
        else:
            return NotImplemented

    def __rmatmul__(self, other):
        return self @ other
````

The `zip` built-in accepts a `strict` keyword-only optional argument since Python 3.10. When `strict=True`, the function raises `ValueError` when the iterables have different lengths. The default is `False`. This new strict behavior is in line with Python’s [*fail fast*](https://fpy.li/16-8) philosophy.

## Rich Comparison Operators

|-----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Equality  | `a == b`       | `a.__eq__(b)`       | `b.__eq__(a)`       | `Return id(a) == id(b)` |

|           | `a <= b`       | `a.__le__(b)`       | `b.__ge__(a)`       | `Raise TypeError`      |

````python
class Vector:
    # many lines omitted

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return (len(self) == len(other) and
                all(a == b for a, b in zip(self, other)))
````

*In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*

````python
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return (len(self) == len(other) and
                    all(a == b for a, b in zip(self, other)))
        else:
            return NotImplemented
````

## Augmented Assignment Operators

Our `Vector` class already supports the augmented assignment operators `+=` and `*=`. That’s because augmented assignment works with immutable receivers by  creating new instances and rebinding the lefthand variable.

the augmented assignment operators work as syntactic sugar: `a += b` is evaluated exactly as `a = a + b`. That’s the expected behavior for immutable types, and if you have `__add__`, then `+=` will work with no additional code.

However, if you do implement an in-place operator method such as `__iadd__`, that method is called to compute the result of `a += b`. As the name says, those operators are expected to change the lefthand  operand in place, and not create a new object as the result.

We can summarize the whole idea of in-place operators by contrasting the return statements that produce results in __add__ and __iadd__ in Example 16-19:

- `__add__` : The result is produced by calling the constructor AddableBingoCage to build a new instance.
- `__iadd__` : The result is produced by returning self, after it has been modified.
