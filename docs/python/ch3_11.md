# A Pythonic Object

Thanks to the Python Data Model, your user-defined types can behave as  naturally as the built-in types. And this can be accomplished without  inheritance, in the spirit of *duck typing*: you just implement the methods needed for your objects to behave as expected.

But if you are writing a library or a framework, the programmers who will use your classes may expect them to behave like the classes that Python provides. Fulfilling that expectation is one way of being “Pythonic.”

## Object Representation

Every object-oriented language has at least one standard way of getting a string representation from any object. Python has 2

- `repr()` : return a string representing the object as the developer want to see it. Its what we get using python console or debugger.
- `str()` : returns a string representing the object as user want to see it. `print()` calls it.

There are two additional special methods to support alternative representations of objects: `__bytes__` and `__format__`.

## Vector Class Redux

````python
from array import array
import math


class Vector2d:
    typecode = 'd'	# Class Attribute

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = float(x)	# early conversion to prevent bugs
        self.y = float(y)

    def __iter__(self):
        return (i for i in (self.x, self.y))	# makes vector iterable

    def __repr__(self):
        class_name = type(self).__name__
        return '{}({!r}, {!r})'.format(class_name, *self) # builds string

    def __str__(self):
        return str(tuple(self))	# tuple for display

    def __bytes__(self): # to generate `bytes` we convert typecode to bytes and concatenate
        return (bytes([ord(self.typecode)]) +
                bytes(array(self.typecode, self)))	

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return tuple(self) == tuple(other) # comparison

    def __abs__(self):
        return math.hypot(self.x, self.y)

    def __bool__(self):
        return bool(abs(self))
````

## An Alternative Contructor

Since we can export a `Vector2d` as bytes, naturally we need a method that imports a `Vector2d` from a binary sequence. Looking at the standard library for inspiration, we find that `array.array` has a class method named `.frombytes` that suits our purpose

````python
    @classmethod # modifies method to be directly callable on a class
    def frombytes(cls, octets): # note we pass cls args rather than self.
        typecode = chr(octets[0]) # read typecode from first byte
        memv = memoryview(octets[1:]).cast(typecode) # create a memory view
        return cls(*memv) # unpack memory view resulting from the cast
````

## classmethod v/s staticmethod

The `classmethod` decorator is not mentioned in the Python tutorial, and neither is `staticmethod`. Anyone who has learned OO in Java may wonder why Python has both of these decorators and not just one of them.

- `classmethod` : to define a method that operates on the class and not on instances.
- `classmethod` changes the way the method is called, so it  receives the class itself as the first argument, instead of an instance. Its most common use is for alternative constructors
- the `staticmethod` decorator changes a method so that it  receives no special first argument. In essence, a static method is just  like a plain function that happens to live in a class body, instead of  being defined at the module level.

````python
class Demo:
  @classmethod
  def Klassmeth(*args):
    return args
  @staticmethod
  def statmeth(*args):
    return args
  
Demo.klassmeth()	# (<class '__main__.Demo'>,)
Demo.klassmeth('spam') # (<class '__main__.Demo'>, 'spam')

Demo.statmeth() # ()
Demo.statmeth('spam') # ('spam',)
````

The `classmethod` decorator is clearly useful, but good use cases for `staticmethod` are very rare in my experience.

## Formatted Displays

The f-strings, the `format()` built-in function, and the `str.format()` method delegate the actual formatting to each type by calling their `.__format__(format_spec)` method.

The `format_spec` is a formatting specifier, which is either:

- The second argument in `format(my_obj, format_spec)`, or
- Whatever appears after the colon in a replacement field delimited with `{}` inside an f-string or the `fmt` in `fmt.str.format()`

````python
brl = 1/4.82
brl	# 0.20746887966804978
format(brl, '0.4f')	# 0.2075
"1 BRL = {rate:0.2f} USD".format(rate=brl)
f"1 USD = {1/brl:0.2f} BRL"	# f string syntax
````

The notation used in the formatting specifier is called the Format Specification Mini-Language.

The Format Specification Mini-Language is extensible because each class gets to interpret the `format_spec` argument as it likes. For instance, the classes in the `datetime` module use the same format codes in the `strftime()` functions and in their `__format__` methods.

````python
from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
format(now, "%H%M:%s")
"It's now {:%I:%M %p}".format(now)
````

````python
  # inside the Vector2d class

    def __format__(self, fmt_spec=''):
        components = (format(c, fmt_spec) for c in self) # apply spec to each component
        return '({}, {})'.format(*components) # plug formatted string in (x,y)
      

# more improved version that support polar co-ordinates using p
    def __format__(self, fmt_spec=''):
        if fmt_spec.endswith('p'):
            fmt_spec = fmt_spec[:-1]
            coords = (abs(self), self.angle())
            outer_fmt = '<{}, {}>'
        else:
            coords = self
            outer_fmt = '({}, {})'
        components = (format(c, fmt_spec) for c in coords)
        return outer_fmt.format(*components)
      
      
# output
format(Vector2d(1, 1), 'p')
format(Vector2d(1, 1), '.3ep')
format(Vector2d(1, 1), '0.5fp')
````

## A Hashable Vector2d

So far `Vector2d` instances are not hashable so we can’t put them in a `set`

To make it hashable we need to implement `__hash__` and `__eq__` (already done) and make vector instances immutable. Because anyone can change them right now using v1.x = 0 and there is nothing in code to prevent that.

````python
class Vector2d:
    typecode = 'd'

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.__x = float(x)	# use __ to make attribute private
        self.__y = float(y)

    @property # marks the getter method of a property
    def x(self): # getter must be named after the public property it exposes
        return self.__x	 # just return self.__x

    @property
    def y(self):
        return self.__y

    def __iter__(self):
        return (i for i in (self.x, self.y))
    
    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.x, self.y))	# hashed the tuple of co-ordinates

    # remaining methods: same as previous Vector2d
````

## Supporting Positional Pattern Matching

So far, Vector2d instances are compatible with keyword class patterns—covered in “Keyword Class Patterns”.

````python
def keyword_pattern_demo(v: Vector2d) -> None:
    match v:
        case Vector2d(x=0, y=0):
            print(f'{v!r} is null')
        case Vector2d(x=0):
            print(f'{v!r} is vertical')
        case Vector2d(y=0):
            print(f'{v!r} is horizontal')
        case Vector2d(x=x, y=y) if x==y:
            print(f'{v!r} is diagonal')
        case _:
            print(f'{v!r} is awesome')
````

However if try to use a position pattern like this: it fails

````python
 				case Vector2d(_, 0):
            print(f'{v!r} is horizontal')
````

```python
TypeError: Vector2d() accepts 0 positional sub-patterns (1 given)
```

To make `Vector2d` work with positional patterns, we need to add a class attribute named `__match_args__` , listing the instance attributes in the order they will be used for positional pattern matching:

````python
class Vector2d:
    __match_args__ = ('x', 'y')
````

Now we can use positional patterns

````python
def positional_pattern_demo(v: Vector2d) -> None:
    match v:
        case Vector2d(0, 0):
            print(f'{v!r} is null')
        case Vector2d(0):
            print(f'{v!r} is vertical')
        case Vector2d(_, 0):
            print(f'{v!r} is horizontal')
        case Vector2d(x, y) if x==y:
            print(f'{v!r} is diagonal')
        case _:
            print(f'{v!r} is awesome')
````

## Private and “Protected” Attributes in Python

In Python, there is no way to create private variables like there is with the `private` modifier in Java. What we have in Python is a simple mechanism to  prevent accidental overwriting of a “private” attribute in a subclass.

Consider this scenario: someone wrote a class named `Dog` that uses a `mood` instance attribute internally, without exposing it. You need to subclass `Dog` as `Beagle`. If you create your own `mood` instance attribute without being aware of the name clash, you will clobber the `mood` attribute used by the methods inherited from `Dog`. This would be a pain to debug.

To prevent this, if you name an instance attribute in the form `__mood` (two leading underscores and zero or at most one trailing underscore), Python stores the name in the instance `__dict__` prefixed with a leading underscore and the class name, so in the `Dog` class, `__mood` becomes `_Dog__mood`, and in `Beagle` it’s `_Beagle__mood`. This language feature goes by the lovely name of *name mangling*.

The name mangling functionality is not loved by all Pythonistas, and neither is the skewed look of names written as `self.__x`. Some prefer to avoid this syntax and use just one underscore prefix to “protect” attributes by convention (e.g., `self._x`)

The single underscore prefix has no special meaning to the Python  interpreter when used in attribute names, but it’s a very strong  convention among Python programmers that you should not access such  attributes from outside the class.

## Saving Memory with `__slots__`

By default, Python stores the attributes of each instance in a `dict` named `__dict__`. A `dict` has a significant memory overhead - even with the optimizations implemented.

- if you define a class attribute named `__slots__` holding a sequence of attribute names, Python uses an alternative storage model for the instance attributes: the attributes named in `__slots__` are stored in a hidden array or references that use less memory than a `dict`

````python
class Pixel:
  __slots__ = ('x', 'y')

p = Pixel()
p.__dict__	# throws attribute error
p.x = 10
p.y = 20
p.color = 'Red' # throws attribute error

# slots are not inherited
class OpenPixel(Pixel):
  pass
op = OpenPixel()
op.__dict__	# works
op.color = 'green'	# works
````

````python
class ColorPixel(Pixel):
  __slots__ = ('color',)

cp = ColorPixel()
cp.__dict__	# raises attribute error
cp.x = 10
cp.color = 'red'
cp.flavor = 'banana'	# raises attribute error
````

### Issues with `__slots__`

- you must remember to redeclare `__slots__` in each subclass to prevent their instance having `__dict__`
- instances will only be able to have attributes listed in `__slots__`, unless we include `__dict__` in slots.
- Classes using `__slots__` can’t use `@chached_property` decorator, unless they explicitly name `__dict__` in `__slots__`
- Instances can’t be targets of weak references unles you add `__weakref__` in `__slots__`



## Overriding Class Attributes

- class attributes can be used as default values for instance attributes
- we can access them as `self.attribute_name`
- if we declare a instance attribute then the class attribute is left untouched and `self.attribute_name` will always reference to instance attribute.
- If you want to change a class attribute, you must set it on the class directly, not through an instance.
- In python more idiomatic way to achieve it how Django does it. Create subclasses which change class attributes.

````python
from vector2d_v3 import Vector2d
class ShortVector2d(Vector2d)
	typecode = 'f'
````

- Another thing to note is following function which doesn’t hardcodes class name in its representation

````python
    # inside class Vector2d:

    def __repr__(self):
        class_name = type(self).__name__
        return '{}({!r}, {!r})'.format(class_name, *self)
````

This way `f` typecodes work fine in representation as well.
