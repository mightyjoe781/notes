# Dynamic Attributes and Properties

- Data Attributes and methods are collectively called as *attributes* in python. Methods are just callable attributes.
- *Dynamic attributes* present same interface as data attributes but are computed on demand following Bertrand Meyer’s Uniform Access Principle.

## Data Wrangling with Dynamic Attributes

- given following JSON Record

````python
{ "Schedule":
  { "conferences": [{"serial": 115 }],
    "events": [
      { "serial": 34505,
        "name": "Why Schools Don´t Use Open Source to Teach Programming",
        "venue_serial": 1462,
        "description": "Aside from the fact that high school programming...",
        "speakers": [157509],
        "categories": ["Education"] }
    ],
    "speakers": [
      { "serial": 157509,
        "name": "Robert Lefkowitz"
      }
    ],
    "venues": [
      { "serial": 1462,
        "name": "F151",
        "category": "Conference Venues" }
    ]
  }
}
````

````python
import json
with open('data/osconfedd.json') as fp:
  feed = json.load(fp)

sorted(feed['Schedule'].keys())
# Output : ['conferences', 'events', 'speakers', 'venues']
feed['Schedule']['speakers'][-1]['name']	# syntax is bad
# Output : 'Carina C. Zona'
````

- above syntax is cumbersome. In JS, we could get the data using `feed.Schedule.events[40].name`. It’s easy to implement a `dict` like class that does similar in python

- There are many ways to do this, with our `FrozenSet` its quite simple

````python
import json
raw_feed = json.load(open('data/osconfeed.json'))
feed = FrozenJSON(raw_feed)
len(feed.Schedule.speakers)
````

````python
from collections import abc

class FrozenJSON:
    """A read-only façade for navigating a JSON-like object
       using attribute notation
    """

    def __init__(self, mapping):
        self.__data = dict(mapping) # make dict from mapping arg

    def __getattr__(self, name): # its called only when there's no attribute with name
        try:
            return getattr(self.__data, name) # nested search
        except AttributeError:
            return FrozenJSON.build(self.__data[name]) # raise error

    def __dir__(self): # supports dir() built-in, supporting auto-completion
        return self.__data.keys()

    @classmethod
    def build(cls, obj): # alternate constructor
        if isinstance(obj, abc.Mapping): # if obj is mapping build frozenjson
            return cls(obj)	# nested jsons
        elif isinstance(obj, abc.MutableSequence): # it must be a list
            return [cls.build(item) for item in obj]	# recursively pass each item to obj recursively
        else: # not a dict or a list return item
            return obj
````

- NOTE: `FrozenJSON` instance has `__data` private instance attributes stored under `_FrozenJSON__data`. Attempts to access this triggers `__getattr__`

### The Invalid Attribute Name Problem

`FrozenJSON` doesn’t support Python keywords as attributes name.

````python
student = FrozenJSON({'name': 'Jim Bo', 'class': 1982})
student.class # invalid syntax error

# but this words
getattr(student, 'class')
````

- A solution is to check whether key in the mapping given to `FrozenJSON.__init__	` is a keyword, and if so, append `_` to it, so the attribute can be read like `student.class_`

````python
    def __init__(self, mapping):
        self.__data = {}
        for key, value in mapping.items():
            if keyword.iskeyword(key):
                key += '_'
            self.__data[key] = value
````

### Flexible Object Creation with `__new__`

- `__init__` is referred as constructor because of adopted jargon from other languages. NOTE: how `__init__` is called with `self` meaning it has already been initialised. Also `__init__` cannot return anything, so its really initialiser, not a constructor.
- python actually calls `__new__` to create a new instance. Its a class method but gets special treatment, so the `@classmethod` decorator is not applied to it. Python takes the instance returns by `__new__` and then passes it as the first argument of `self` of `__init__`.
- If necessary, the `__new__` method can also return an instance of a different class when that happends interpretor doesn’t call `__init__`

````python
# pseudocode for object construction
def make(the_class, some_arg):
    new_object = the_class.__new__(some_arg)
    if isinstance(new_object, the_class):
        the_class.__init__(new_object, some_arg)
    return new_object

# the following statements are roughly equivalent
x = Foo('bar')
x = make(Foo, 'bar')
````

````python
from collections import abc
import keyword

class FrozenJSON:
    """A read-only façade for navigating a JSON-like object
       using attribute notation
    """

    def __new__(cls, arg): # passing class here
        if isinstance(arg, abc.Mapping):
            return super().__new__(cls) # default behaviour is to delegate to __new__ of a superclass
        elif isinstance(arg, abc.MutableSequence):
            return [cls(item) for item in arg]
        else:
            return arg

    def __init__(self, mapping):
        self.__data = {}
        for key, value in mapping.items():
            if keyword.iskeyword(key):
                key += '_'
            self.__data[key] = value

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        try:
            return getattr(self.__data, name)
        except AttributeError:
            return FrozenJSON(self.__data[name])

    def __dir__(self):
        return self.__data.keys()
````

## Computed Properties

We have used `@property` decorator used to make attributes read-only.

````python
{ "serial": 33950,	# here this is linked to venue and speakers db
  "name": "There *Will* Be Bugs",
  "event_type": "40-minute conference session",
  "time_start": "2014-07-23 14:30:00",
  "time_stop": "2014-07-23 15:10:00",
  "venue_serial": 1449,
  "description": "If you're pushing the envelope of programming...",
  "website_url": "http://oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/33950",
  "speakers": [3471, 5199],
  "categories": ["Python"] }
````

- We will implement a Event class with `venue` and `speaker` properties to return the linked data automatically. (dereferencing the serial number)

### 1. Data Driven Attribute Creations

- fields from the original JSON can be retrieved as `Record` instance attributes

````python
import json

JSON_PATH = 'data/osconfeed.json'

class Record:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs) # shortcut to build an instance with attributes created from keyword arguments

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<{self.__class__.__name__} serial={self.serial!r}>' # using serial field to build custom Record Representation

def load(path=JSON_PATH):
    records = {}
    with open(path) as fp:
        raw_data = json.load(fp) # parse json
    for collection, raw_records in raw_data['Schedule'].items():
        record_type = collection[:-1] # list name without last char (remove s from suffixes)
        for raw_record in raw_records:
            key = f'{record_type}.{raw_record["serial"]}' # Events.some_val
            records[key] = Record(**raw_record) # create record objects
    return records
````

- This is much better than previous recursive FrozenJSON implementation.

### 2. Property to Retrieve Linked Record

- The goal of this next version is: given an `event` record, reading its `venue` property will return a `Record`

````python
event = Record.fetch('event.33950')	# instance of Event class
event	# There will be Bugs
event.venue	# <Record serial=1449> # returns a Record instance
event.venue.name # Portland 251
````

- `Event` is a subclass of `Record` adding a `venue` to retrieve linked records, and a specialized `__repr__` method.

````python
# Record Class
import inspect # used for load
import json

JSON_PATH = 'data/osconfeed.json'

class Record:

    __index = None # private class attribute eventually holding reference to dict returned by load

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<{self.__class__.__name__} serial={self.serial!r}>'

    @staticmethod # static method
    def fetch(key):
        if Record.__index is None: # populate the Record.__index if necessary
            Record.__index = load()
        return Record.__index[key]
````

````python
 # Event Class
class Event(Record): # Event extends Record

    def __repr__(self):
        try:
            return f'<{self.__class__.__name__} {self.name!r}>' # if instance has a name attribute it is used to produce a custom representation or else delegate to `__repr__` from Record
        except AttributeError:
            return super().__repr__()

    @property
    def venue(self):
        key = f'venue.{self.venue_serial}'
        return self.__class__.fetch(key) # build a key from venue.serial_num
````

````python
# load function
def load(path=JSON_PATH):
    records = {}
    with open(path) as fp:
        raw_data = json.load(fp)
    for collection, raw_records in raw_data['Schedule'].items():
        record_type = collection[:-1]
        cls_name = record_type.capitalize()
        cls = globals().get(cls_name, Record) # search for class based on key name like Event
        if inspect.isclass(cls) and issubclass(cls, Record): # check if subclass of Record
            factory = cls # bind factory name to new class
        else:
            factory = Record # or bind to Record
        for raw_record in raw_records:
            key = f'{record_type}.{raw_record["serial"]}'
            records[key] = factory(**raw_record) # store the record and store in records which is contructed by factory
    return records
````

### 3. Property Overriding an Existing Attribute

````python
    @property
    def speakers(self):
        spkr_serials = self.__dict__['speakers'] # directly retrieve from __dict__
        fetch = self.__class__.fetch
        return [fetch(f'speaker.{key}')
                for key in spkr_serials] # return list of all records with key corresponding to the numbers in spkr_serials
````

### 4. Bespoke Property Cache

- Caching property is a common need because there is an expectation that expression like `event.venue` should be inexpensive.
- The handmade caching is straightforward, but creating an attribute after the instance is initialized defeats the PEP 412—Key-Sharing Dictionary optimization, as explained in “Practical Consequences of How dict Works”. Depending on the size of the dataset, the difference in memory usage may be important.

````python
class Event(Record):

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self.__speaker_objs = None	# code this to quikly check if speakers are there or not
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

# 15 lines omitted...
    @property
    def speakers(self):
        if self.__speaker_objs is None:
            spkr_serials = self.__dict__['speakers']
            fetch = self.__class__.fetch
            self.__speaker_objs = [fetch(f'speaker.{key}')
                    for key in spkr_serials]
        return self.__speaker_objs
````

### 5. Caching using functools

````python
    @cached_property
    def venue(self):
        key = f'venue.{self.venue_serial}'
        return self.__class__.fetch(key)
````

- The `@cached_property` decorator does not create a full-fledged property, it creates a *nonoverriding descriptor*. A descriptor is an object that manages the access to an attribute in another class.
- differences between `cached_property` and `property` from a user’s point of view.
  - The mechanics of `cached_property()` are somewhat different from `property()`. A regular property blocks attribute writes unless a setter is defined. In contrast, a `cached_property` allows writes.
  - The `cached_property` decorator only runs on lookups and only when an attribute of the same name doesn’t exist. When it does run, the `cached_property` writes to the attribute with the same name. Subsequent attribute reads and writes take precedence over the `cached_property` method and it works like a normal attribute.
  - The cached value can be cleared by deleting the attribute. This allows the `cached_property` method to run again

`@cached_property` has some important limitations:

- It cannot be used as a drop-in replacement to `@property` if the decorated method already depends on an instance attribute with the same name.
- It cannot be used in a class that defines `__slots__`.
- It defeats the key-sharing optimization of the instance `__dict__`, because it creates an instance attribute after `__init__`.

Despite this `@cached_property` addresses a common need in a simple way and it is thread-safe. Alternate solution that we can use with speaker is to stack `@property` and `@cache` decorators

````python
  	@property # note this order is important speaker= property(cache(speaker))
    @cache
    def speakers(self):
        spkr_serials = self.__dict__['speakers']
        fetch = self.__class__.fetch
        return [fetch(f'speaker.{key}')
                for key in spkr_serials]
````

## Using a Property for Attribute Validation

- Besides computing attribute values, properties are also used to enforce business rules by changing a public attribute into a protected attribute by getter and setter.

### LineItem Take #1: Class for an Item in an Order

````python
class LineItem:
  def __init__(self, desc, weight, price):
    self.description = desc
    self.weight = weight
    self.price = price
  
  def subtotal(self):
    return self.weight * self.price
````

````python
raisins = LineItem('Golden raisins', 10, 6.95)
raisins.subtotal()
# Output : 69.5
raisins.weight = -20  # garbage in...
raisins.subtotal()    # garbage out...
# Output : -139.0
````

### LineItem Take #2: A Validating Property

````python
class LineItem:

    def __init__(self, description, weight, price):
        self.description = description
        self.weight = weight
        self.price = price

    def subtotal(self):
        return self.weight * self.price

    @property  # decorate getter
    def weight(self):
        return self.__weight # actual value stored in __weight

    @weight.setter # setter property
    def weight(self, value):
        if value > 0:
            self.__weight = value # only update property when val > 0
        else:
            raise ValueError('value must be > 0') 
````

## A proper look at Properties

- Although often used as a decorator, the `property` built-in is actually a class.
- In Python, functions and classes are often interchangeable, because both are callable and there is no `new` operator for object instantiation, so invoking a constructor is no  different from invoking a factory function. And both can be used as  decorators, as long as they return a new callable that is a suitable  replacement of the decorated callable.

````python
# property signature
property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)
````

- A much simpler approach compared with decorator is creating `set_weight` and `get_weight` functions and then defining class attribute `weight = property(get_weight, set_weight)`

### Properties Override Instance Attributes

- Properties are always class attributes, but they actually manage attribute access in the instance of the class.
- Instance attributes shadow same named class attributes.

````python
class Class:
  data = 'the class data attr'
  
  @property
  def prop(self):
    return 'the prop value'
obj = Class()
vars(obj)	# {}
obj.data	# 'the class data attr'
obj.data = 'bar' # shadow by instance attributes
vars(obj)	# {'data': 'bar'}
obj.data	# Output : 'bar'
Class.data	# 'the class data attr'

# let's try to shadow class property
New class property shadows the existing instance attribute

Class.prop	# <property object ...>
obj.prop	# 'the prop value'
obj.prop = 'foo'	# AttributeError becuase directly executes property getter
# lets modify the object data dict
obj.__dict__['prop'] = 'foo'
vars(obj)	# {'data': 'bar', 'prop':'foo'}	# this prop is instance attribute
obj.prop	# 'the prop value'	# this still runs property getter, so its not shadowed
Class.prop = 'baz'	# class property destroyed, now its class attribute
obj.prop	# 'foo'	# shadow now works, obj.prop retrieves the instance attribute

# New class property shadows the existing instance attribute

obj.data	# 'bar'
Class.data	# the class data attr
Class.data = property(lambda self: 'the data prop value')
obj.data	# property is called, instance attribute is shadowed
del Class.data
obj.data	# 'bar'
````

- The main point of this section is that an expression like `obj.data` does not start the search for `data` in `obj`. The search actually starts at `obj.__class__`, and only if there is no property named `data` in the class, Python looks in the `obj` instance itself.

### Property Documentation

When tools such as the console `help()` function or IDEs need to display the documentation of a property, they extract the information from the `__doc__` attribute of the property.

If used with the classic call syntax, `property` can get the documentation string as the `doc` argument:

```
    weight = property(get_weight, set_weight, doc='weight in kilograms')
```

```python
# Documentation Example
class Foo:

    @property
    def bar(self):
        """The bar attribute"""
        return self.__dict__['bar']

    @bar.setter
    def bar(self, value):
        self.__dict__['bar'] = value
```

## Coding a Property Factory

We will create a factory to create `quantity` properties - so named because the managed attributes represent quantities that can’t be negative or zero in the application.

````python
class LineItem:
    weight = quantity('weight') # factory calls
    price = quantity('price')

    def __init__(self, description, weight, price):
        self.description = description
        self.weight = weight	# here the property works automatically
        self.price = price

    def subtotal(self):
        return self.weight * self.price
````

````python
def quantity(storage_name): # where data for each property is stored like 'weight' or 'price'

    def qty_getter(instance): # getter
        return instance.__dict__[storage_name] # return the property

    def qty_setter(instance, value):
        if value > 0:
            instance.__dict__[storage_name] = value
        else:
            raise ValueError('value must be > 0')

    return property(qty_getter, qty_setter) # return the property
````

## Handling Attribute Deletion

- We can not only delete variables but attributes as well using `del`
- In practice, deleting attributes is not something we do every day in Python, and the requirement to handle it with a property is even more unusual.

## Essential Attributes and Function for Attributes Handling

### Special Attributes that Affect Attribute Handling

- `__class__` : A reference to the object’s class. Python looks for special methods such as `__getattr__` only in an object’s class and not in the instance themselves.
- `__dict__`: A mapping that stores the writeable attributes of an object or class. An object that has a `__dict__` can have arbitrary new attributes set at any time. If a class has a `__slots__` attribute, then its instances may not have a `__dict__`.
- `__slots__` : An attribute that may be defined in a class to save memory. `__slots__` is a `tuple` of strings naming the allowed attributes

### Built-in Functions for Attribute Handling

- `dir([object])` : lists most attributes of the object. The official docs say dir is intended for interactive use so it does not provide a comprehensive list of attributes, but an “interesting” set of names. dir can inspect objects implemented with or without a __dict__. The __dict__ attribute itself is not listed by dir, but the __dict__ keys are listed. Several special attributes of classes, such as __mro__, __bases__, and __name__, are not listed by dir either.
- `getattr(object, name[, default])` : Gets the attribute identified by the `name` string from the `object`. The main use case is to retrieve attributes (or methods) whose names we don’t know beforehand. This may fetch an attribute from the object’s class or from a superclass.
- `hasattr(object, name)` : Returns `True` if the named attribute exists in the `object`, or can be somehow fetched through it (by inheritance, for example).
- `setattr(object, name, value)` : Assigns the `value` to the named attribute of `object`, if the `object` allows it. This may create a new attribute or overwrite an existing one.
- `vars([object])` : Returns the `__dict__` of `object`; `vars` can’t deal with instances of classes that define `__slots__` and don’t have a `__dict__` (contrast with `dir`, which handles such instances). Without an argument, `vars()` does the same as `locals()`: returns a `dict` representing the local scope.

### Special Methods for Attribute Handling

- `__delattr__(self, name)` : Always called when there is an attempt to delete an attribute using the `del` statement;
- `__dir__(self)` : Called when `dir` is invoked on the object, to provide a listing of attributes; `dir(obj)` triggers `Class.__dir__(obj)`. Also used by tab-completion in all modern Python consoles.
- `__getattr__(self, name)` : Called only when an attempt to retrieve the named attribute fails, after the `obj`, `Class`, and its superclasses are searched. The expressions `obj.no_such_attr`, `getattr(obj, 'no_such_attr')`, and `hasattr(obj, 'no_such_attr')` may trigger `Class.__getattr__(obj, 'no_such_attr')`, but only if an attribute by that name cannot be found in `obj` or in `Class` and its superclasses.
- `__getattribute__(self, name)` : Always called when there is an attempt to retrieve the named attribute  directly from Python code (the interpreter may bypass this in some  cases, for example, to get the `__repr__` method). Dot notation and the `getattr` and `hasattr` built-ins trigger this method.
- `__setattr__(self, name, value)` : Always called when there is an attempt to set the named attribute. Dot notation and the `setattr` built-in trigger this method
