# Problem Clarification

*The foundational phase that transforms vague, open-ended problems into well-defined, actionable requirements that guide the entire design process.*

### Overview

Problem clarification is the critical first step in any system design interview or real-world system architecture. It establishes the foundation for all subsequent design decisions and demonstrates your ability to think systematically about complex problems.

**Why Problem Clarification Matters:**

- **Demonstrates structured thinking**: Shows systematic approach to complex problems
- **Prevents scope creep**: Establishes clear boundaries for the design
- **Identifies critical constraints**: Uncovers hidden requirements early
- **Shows domain understanding**: Demonstrates knowledge of real-world systems
- **Guides design decisions**: Provides framework for architectural choices

**Common Pitfalls:**

- **Jumping to solutions**: Starting design before understanding requirements
- **Making assumptions**: Assuming requirements without validation
- **Scope ambiguity**: Unclear boundaries leading to unfocused design
- **Missing constraints**: Overlooking critical technical or business constraints
- **Over-engineering**: Building unnecessary complexity without clear requirements

**Problem Clarification Framework:**

1. **Understand the problem domain**: What type of system are we building?
2. **Define functional scope**: What features must the system support?
3. **Establish non-functional requirements**: How well must the system perform?
4. **Identify constraints**: What limitations must we work within?
5. **Validate assumptions**: Confirm understanding with stakeholders

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structure the conversation**: Use a systematic approach to uncover all requirements
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Don't assume - validate your understanding
3. **Distinguish must-have from nice-to-have**: Focus on core requirements first
4. **Quantify non-functional requirements**: Get specific numbers for scale and performance
5. **Identify constraints early**: Understanding limitations guides design decisions
6. **Document assumptions**: Make implicit requirements explicit
7. **Validate understanding**: Confirm requirements with stakeholders

### Common Problem Clarification Mistakes

- **Assuming too much**: Making unstated assumptions about requirements
- **Skipping non-functional requirements**: Focusing only on features, not performance
- **Ignoring constraints**: Not identifying technical or business limitations
- **Over-specifying**: Defining requirements in too much detail too early
- **Under-specifying**: Being too vague about critical requirements
- **Missing stakeholders**: Not considering all types of users and use cases

### Interview Tips

**Effective Questions:**

- "What does success look like for this system?"
- "Who are the primary users and what are their main goals?"
- "What scale are we designing for - users, data, requests?"
- "What constraints do we need to work within?"
- "Are there any existing systems we need to integrate with?"

**Red Flags:**

- Starting to design before understanding requirements
- Not asking about scale or performance requirements
- Ignoring edge cases and error scenarios
- Not clarifying the scope and boundaries
- Making technology choices before understanding constraints

> **Remember**: Good problem clarification is like building a strong foundation - it makes everything else easier and more stable. Take time to really understand what you're building before you start designing how to build it.
