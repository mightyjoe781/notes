### Authentication and Authorization Deep-dive

**JWT Token-Based Authentication:**

**JWT Structure and Implementation:**

**JWT Components:**

- **Header**: Algorithm and token type information
- **Payload**: Claims about the user and session
- **Signature**: Cryptographic verification of token integrity

**Authentication Flow:**

1. **User Login Request:**
   - Client sends credentials to authentication service
   - Service validates credentials against user database
   - Service generates JWT with user claims and expiration
   - JWT returned to client with refresh token
2. **Token Usage:**
   - Client includes JWT in Authorization header
   - Each service validates JWT signature locally
   - Services extract user information from token claims
   - No database lookup required for authentication
3. **Token Refresh:**
   - Access tokens have short expiration (15-30 minutes)
   - Refresh tokens have longer expiration (days/weeks)
   - Client automatically refreshes expired access tokens
   - Refresh tokens can be revoked for security

**Token Validation Process:**

```
JWT Validation Steps:
1. Extract token from Authorization header
2. Verify token format and structure
3. Validate signature using public key
4. Check token expiration timestamp
5. Verify issuer and audience claims
6. Extract user information from payload
7. Check token against revocation list (if required)
```

**Authorization Implementation:**

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

**RBAC Structure:**

- **Users**: Individual accounts in the system

- **Resources**: Objects being protected (posts, users, comments)

**Permission Checking Flow:**

```
Authorization Process:
1. Extract user ID from validated JWT token
2. Load user roles from cache or database
3. Determine required permission for operation
4. Check if user roles include required permission
5. Verify resource ownership if applicable
6. Allow or deny request based on permissions
```

   - Request votes from other nodes
3. Node becomes leader if receives majority votes
4. Leader sends heartbeats to maintain authority
```

**Log Replication in Raft:**

## Error Handling Strategies

### Failure Modes and Recovery

**Common Failure Scenarios:**

**Service Unavailability:**

- **Network partitions**: Services can't communicate
- **Service overload**: Too many requests for capacity
- **Deployment failures**: New code breaks service
- **Resource exhaustion**: Out of memory, disk space, connections

**Data Consistency Issues:**

- **Partial writes**: Some operations succeed, others fail
- **Concurrent modifications**: Multiple users modify same data
- **Replication lag**: Read replicas behind primary database
- **Cache inconsistency**: Cache and database out of sync

**External Dependencies:**

- **Third-party API failures**: Payment processors, email services
- **Database outages**: Primary or replica database unavailable
- **Message queue failures**: Lost or delayed messages
- **CDN issues**: Content delivery problems

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**

**Circuit Breaker States:**

```
Circuit Breaker State Machine:
CLOSED (Normal Operation):
- All requests pass through to service
- Track failure rate and response times
- Switch to OPEN if failure threshold exceeded

OPEN (Failing Fast):
- All requests immediately return error
- No calls made to failing service
- After timeout period, switch to HALF_OPEN

HALF_OPEN (Testing Recovery):
- Limited requests allowed through
- If requests succeed, switch to CLOSED
- If requests fail, switch back to OPEN
```

**Circuit Breaker Configuration:**

```
Circuit Breaker Parameters:
- Failure threshold: 50% failure rate over 10 requests
- Timeout: 60 seconds before trying HALF_OPEN
- Success threshold: 5 consecutive successes to close
- Request volume threshold: Minimum 20 requests to evaluate
- Response time threshold: 5 seconds = slow response
```

**Fallback Strategies:**

**Graceful Degradation:**

- **Cached data**: Serve stale data when service unavailable
- **Default values**: Return sensible defaults instead of errors
- **Simplified functionality**: Reduce features when dependencies fail
- **Manual overrides**: Allow operators to provide fallback responses

### Retry Mechanisms

**Exponential Backoff:**

**Retry Strategy Implementation:**

```
Exponential Backoff Algorithm:
retry_count = 0
max_retries = 5
base_delay = 100ms
max_delay = 30s

while retry_count < max_retries:
    try:
        result = execute_operation()
        return result
    except retryable_error:
        retry_count += 1
        delay = min(base_delay * (2^retry_count), max_delay)
        jitter = random(0, delay * 0.1)  # Add jitter
        sleep(delay + jitter)
    except non_retryable_error:
        raise immediately

throw max_retries_exceeded_error
```

**Jitter Strategies:**

- **Full jitter**: delay = random(0, exponential_delay)
- **Equal jitter**: delay = exponential_delay/2 + random(0, exponential_delay/2)
- **Decorrelated jitter**: delay = random(base_delay, previous_delay * 3)

**Idempotency Handling:**

**Idempotent Operation Design:**

```
Idempotency Implementation:
1. Client generates unique request ID (UUID)
2. Server checks if request ID already processed
3. If processed, return previous result
4. If not processed, execute operation
5. Store result with request ID
6. Return result to client

Benefits:
- Safe to retry any operation
- Prevents duplicate processing
- Maintains data consistency
- Simplifies client retry logic
```

### Data Validation and Sanitization

**Input Validation Layers:**

**Multi-Layer Validation:**

```
Validation Pipeline:
1. Client-side validation (user experience)
2. API gateway validation (format, size)
3. Service-level validation (business rules)
4. Database constraints (data integrity)
5. Output validation (security, format)
```

**Validation Techniques:**

**Schema Validation:**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email",
      "maxLength": 255
    },
    "age": {
      "type": "integer",
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 150
    },
    "tags": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"type": "string"},
      "maxItems": 10
    }
  },
  "required": ["email"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Business Rule Validation:**

- **Domain constraints**: Valid user roles, status transitions
- **Temporal constraints**: Future dates, business hours
- **Relational constraints**: User owns resource, valid references
- **Contextual constraints**: User permissions, rate limits

**Security Validation:**

**Input Sanitization:**

```
Security Validation Steps:
1. SQL injection prevention:
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Escape special characters
   - Validate input types

2. XSS prevention:
   - HTML encode output
   - Content Security Policy
   - Input filtering

3. Command injection prevention:
   - Avoid system calls with user input
   - Use allowlists for commands
   - Validate file paths

4. Data exposure prevention:
   - Remove sensitive fields from responses
   - Mask personal information
   - Implement field-level permissions
```

### Monitoring and Observability

**Distributed Tracing:**

**Trace Implementation:**

```
Distributed Tracing Flow:
1. Request enters system with trace ID
2. Each service adds span with:
   - Service name and operation
   - Start and end timestamps
   - Tags and metadata
   - Parent span relationship
3. Spans collected by tracing system
4. Traces assembled for analysis
5. Performance bottlenecks identified
```

**Error Tracking and Alerting:**

**Error Classification:**

```
Error Categories:
1. User errors (4xx):
   - Invalid input
   - Authentication failures
   - Authorization denials
   - Resource not found

2. System errors (5xx):
   - Service unavailable
   - Database timeouts
   - Memory exhaustion
   - Third-party failures

3. Business logic errors:
   - Rule violations
   - State inconsistencies
   - Workflow failures
   - Data corruption
```

**Alert Configuration:**

```
Alerting Strategy:
1. Error rate thresholds:
   - >5% 4xx errors over 5 minutes
   - >1% 5xx errors over 2 minutes
   - >10s average response time

2. Service health checks:
   - Health endpoint monitoring
   - Dependency availability
   - Resource utilization

3. Business metrics:
   - User registration rate drops
   - Payment failure rate increases
   - Content upload failures
```
