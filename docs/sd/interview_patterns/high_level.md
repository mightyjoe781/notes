# High-Level Design

*The core phase where you translate requirements into concrete system architecture, identify major components, and design the fundamental structure that addresses all functional and non-functional requirements.*

### Overview

High-Level Design (HLD) transforms well-defined requirements into a coherent system architecture. This phase typically takes 15-20 minutes in interviews and forms the foundation for detailed discussions. The goal is to create a logical system design that addresses all requirements while being scalable and maintainable.

**High-Level Design Goals:**

- **Overall architecture**: How major components fit together
- **Data flow**: How information moves through the system
- **Component responsibilities**: What each part of the system does
- **Interface contracts**: How components communicate
- **Storage strategy**: How and where data is stored

**Success Criteria:**

- **Addresses all requirements**: Covers functional and non-functional needs
- **Logical structure**: Components and relationships make sense
- **Scalable foundation**: Architecture can grow with requirements
- **Clear boundaries**: Well-defined component responsibilities
- **Communication clarity**: Interviewer can follow your reasoning

## API Design

### RESTful API Design

**REST Principles:**

**Resource-Based Design:**

**RESTful API Structure:**

- **Resources**: Use nouns, not verbs (users, posts, comments)
- **HTTP Methods**: Use standard verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Status Codes**: Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Consistent naming**: Follow consistent URL patterns
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all necessary information

**API Design Examples:**

**Social Media API Structure:**

**User Management:**

- `POST /users` - Register new user
- `GET /users/{id}` - Get user profile
- `PUT /users/{id}` - Update complete profile
- `PATCH /users/{id}` - Update partial profile
- `DELETE /users/{id}` - Delete user account

**Content Management:**

- `POST /posts` - Create new post
- `GET /posts/{id}` - Get specific post
- `PUT /posts/{id}` - Update entire post
- `DELETE /posts/{id}` - Delete post
- `GET /users/{id}/posts` - Get user's posts

**Social Features:**

- `POST /users/{id}/follow` - Follow user
- `DELETE /users/{id}/follow` - Unfollow user
- `GET /users/{id}/followers` - Get followers list
- `POST /posts/{id}/like` - Like post
- `POST /posts/{id}/comments` - Add comment

**Feed and Discovery:**

- `GET /feed` - Get personalized feed
- `GET /posts/search?q={query}` - Search posts
- `GET /users/search?q={query}` - Search users

**API Pagination and Filtering:**

**Pagination Strategies:**

| Method           | Example                              | Pros                                   | Cons                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Offset-based** | `GET /posts?page=2&limit=20`         | Easy to implement, familiar            | Issues with data changes     |
| **Cursor-based** | `GET /posts?cursor=abc123&limit=20`  | Consistent results, real-time friendly | More complex implementation  |
| **Key-based**    | `GET /posts?since_id=12345&limit=20` | Efficient for time-ordered data        | Limited to specific ordering |

**Filtering and Sorting:**

- `GET /posts?category=tech&sort=created_at&order=desc`
- `GET /users?verified=true&location=SF&limit=50`
- `GET /posts?created_after=2024-01-01&author_id=123`

### GraphQL vs REST

**GraphQL Benefits:**

**Flexible Queries:**

- Client specifies exact data needed
- Single request for multiple resources
- Nested data fetching in one call
- Reduced over-fetching and under-fetching

**Type System:**

- Strongly typed schema definition
- Auto-generated documentation
- Client-side validation and IDE support
- Schema introspection capabilities

**Evolution:**

- Schema evolution without versioning
- Field deprecation handling
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Field-level changes without breaking clients

**Developer Experience:**

- Single endpoint for all operations
- Real-time subscriptions built-in
- Rich ecosystem and tooling
- Self-documenting APIs

**When to Choose GraphQL vs REST:**

| Factor             | REST                       | GraphQL                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Caching**        | Simple HTTP caching        | Complex caching strategies needed  |
| **Learning Curve** | Low, widely understood     | Higher, requires GraphQL knowledge |
| **File Uploads**   | Native HTTP support        | Requires extensions or workarounds |
| **Real-time**      | WebSocket/SSE needed       | Built-in subscriptions             |
| **Mobile Apps**    | Over-fetching common       | Optimized data fetching            |
| **Public APIs**    | Wide compatibility         | Growing but limited adoption       |
| **Team Size**      | Works well for small teams | Better tooling for larger teams    |

### API Security and Rate Limiting

**Authentication Methods:**

**API Key Authentication:**

- Simple to implement and understand
- Good for server-to-server communication
- Difficult to secure in client applications
- No built-in expiration mechanism

**JWT Token Authentication:**

- Stateless authentication mechanism
- Contains user information and claims
- Can be verified without database lookup
- Built-in expiration and refresh handling

**OAuth 2.0:**

- Industry standard for delegated authorization
- Excellent for third-party integrations
- Supports scoped permissions
- Complex but comprehensive security model

**Session-based Authentication:**

- Server-side session storage
- Simple implementation for traditional apps
- Stateful (requires sticky sessions or shared storage)
- Good for web applications with server-side rendering

**Rate Limiting Strategies:**

**Per-User Rate Limiting:**

- 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user
- Different limits for different user tiers (free, premium, enterprise)
- Identify users by API key, JWT token, or session
- Store rate limit counters in Redis or database

**Per-IP Rate Limiting:**

- Broader protection against anonymous abuse
- Useful for public endpoints without authentication
- Issues with shared IPs (corporate networks, mobile carriers)
- Easier to implement but less granular

**Per-Endpoint Rate Limiting:**

- Different limits for different API operations
- Expensive operations (search, reports) get lower limits
- Separate limits for read vs write operations
- More granular control over system resources

**Adaptive Rate Limiting:**

- Adjust limits based on current system load
- Higher limits during low traffic periods
- Emergency throttling during system stress
- Machine learning-based limit optimization

**Rate Limiting Implementation:**

**Token Bucket Algorithm:**

```
Rate Limiting with Token Bucket:
- Bucket has maximum capacity (burst allowance)
- Tokens added at fixed rate (sustained rate)
- Each request consumes one token
- Reject requests when bucket is empty
- Allows traffic bursts up to bucket capacity
```

**Sliding Window Algorithm:**

```
Sliding Window Rate Limiting:
- Track requests in time windows
- Window slides continuously with time
- More accurate than fixed windows
- Higher memory and computation overhead
- Better user experience with smoother limits
```

## Database Schema Design

### Data Modeling Approach

**Entity Relationship Design:**

**Entity Identification Process:**

1. **Identify Core Entities:**
   - **Users**: Authentication and profile data
   - **Content**: Posts, comments, media files
   - **Relationships**: Follows, likes, shares, friendships
   - **Metadata**: Timestamps, analytics, system data
2. **Define Attributes:**
   - **Required vs Optional**: Critical data vs enhancement data
   - **Data types and constraints**: String lengths, numeric ranges
   - **Indexing requirements**: Query optimization needs
   - **Validation rules**: Business logic constraints
3. **Establish Relationships:**
   - **One-to-One**: User → Profile (extended user data)
   - **One-to-Many**: User → Posts (user creates multiple posts)
   - **Many-to-Many**: Users ↔ Users (follow relationships)
   - **Hierarchical**: Comments → Comments (nested comments)

**Social Media Schema Example:**

**Users Table:**

```sql
Users:
├── user_id (Primary Key, UUID)
├── username (Unique, Indexed)
├── email (Unique, Indexed)
├── password_hash (Encrypted)
├── display_name (Display name for UI)
├── bio (User description)
├── avatar_url (Profile picture)
├── verified (Boolean flag)
├── created_at (Timestamp, Indexed)
└── updated_at (Timestamp)
```

**Posts Table:**

```sql
Posts:
├── post_id (Primary Key, UUID)
├── user_id (Foreign Key → Users, Indexed)
├── content (Text content)
├── media_urls (JSON Array of media)
├── post_type (Enum: text, image, video)
├── visibility (Enum: public, private, friends)
├── like_count (Integer, Denormalized)
├── comment_count (Integer, Denormalized)
├── created_at (Timestamp, Indexed)
└── updated_at (Timestamp)
```

**Follows Table (Many-to-Many):**

```sql
Follows:
├── follower_id (Foreign Key → Users)
├── following_id (Foreign Key → Users)
├── created_at (Timestamp)
└── PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, following_id)
```

**Likes Table:**

```sql
Likes:
├── like_id (Primary Key, UUID)
├── user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
├── post_id (Foreign Key → Posts)
├── created_at (Timestamp)
└── UNIQUE(user_id, post_id)
```

**Normalization vs Denormalization:**

**Normalization Benefits:**

- **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth, no duplicate data
- **Storage Efficiency**: Reduced storage space and backup sizes
- **Maintenance**: Schema changes easier, centralized validation
- **Integrity**: Referential integrity and business rules enforcement

**Denormalization for Performance:**

**Denormalization Strategies:**

- **Pre-calculate aggregations**: Store like_count, comment_count in posts
- **Duplicate frequently accessed data**: User display_name in posts
- **Flatten hierarchical data**: Avoid complex joins for common queries
- **Store computed values**: Cache expensive calculations

**When to Denormalize:**

- **Read-heavy workloads**: Many more reads than writes
- **Performance critical paths**: Core user experience queries
- **Complex aggregations**: Expensive real-time calculations
- **Cache-friendly design**: Data locality and reduced cache misses

### NoSQL Schema Design

**Document Database Design (MongoDB):**

**User Document Example:**

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "profile": {
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "bio": "Software Engineer",
    "avatar_url": "https://...",
    "location": "San Francisco"
  },
  "stats": {
    "followers_count": 1250,
    "following_count": 180,
    "posts_count": 89
  },
  "created_at": ISODate("..."),
  "updated_at": ISODate("...")
}
```

**Post Document Example:**

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "user_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "content": "Hello, world!",
  "media": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "url": "https://...",
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    }
  ],
  "engagement": {
    "likes": 42,
    "comments": 5,
    "shares": 2
  },
  "hashtags": ["hello", "world", "firstpost"],
  "mentions": ["@jane_doe"],
  "created_at": ISODate("..."),
  "updated_at": ISODate("...")
}
```

**Key-Value Store Design (Redis):**

**Redis Data Structure Patterns:**

**User Sessions:**

- **Key**: `session:{session_id}`
- **Value**: JSON user data
- **TTL**: 24 hours
- **Use Case**: Authentication state management

**Feed Cache:**

- **Key**: `feed:{user_id}`
- **Value**: List of post IDs
- **TTL**: 15 minutes
- **Use Case**: Personalized feed caching

**Counters:**

- **Key**: `likes:{post_id}`
- **Value**: Integer count
- **Operations**: INCR, DECR for real-time updates
- **Use Case**: Real-time engagement metrics

**Rate Limiting:**

- **Key**: `rate_limit:{user_id}:{endpoint}`
- **Value**: Request count
- **TTL**: 1 hour sliding window
- **Use Case**: API rate limiting enforcement

**Leaderboards:**

- **Key**: `trending_posts`
- **Value**: Sorted set (score, post_id)
- **Operations**: ZADD, ZRANGE for rankings
- **Use Case**: Trending content discovery

### Data Partitioning Strategy

**Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):**

**Sharding Strategies:**

**Range-Based Sharding:**

- **Method**: Partition by user_id ranges (1-1M, 1M-2M, etc.)
- **Pros**: Simple to implement, supports range queries
- **Cons**: Potential hot spots, uneven data distribution
- **Use Case**: When data has natural ordering

**Hash-Based Sharding:**

- **Method**: Hash user_id % number_of_shards
- **Pros**: Even distribution across shards
- **Cons**: Difficult to add shards, no range queries
- **Use Case**: When even distribution is priority

**Directory-Based Sharding:**

- **Method**: Lookup service maps keys to shards
- **Pros**: Flexible mapping, easy resharding
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, potential bottleneck
- **Use Case**: When flexibility is required

**Geographic Sharding:**

- **Method**: Partition by user location or data center
- **Pros**: Reduced latency, regulatory compliance
- **Cons**: Uneven geographic distribution
- **Use Case**: Global applications with data residency requirements

**Sharding Challenges:**

**Cross-Shard Operations:**

- **Joins across shards**: Expensive and complex to implement
- **Aggregations**: Require application-level coordination
- **Transactions**: Limited to single shard or complex 2PC
- **Solutions**: Denormalization, application-level joins

**Rebalancing:**

- **Adding shards**: Data migration and traffic redirection
- **Removing shards**: Data consolidation and cleanup
- **Hot spot handling**: Dynamic load balancing
- **Solutions**: Consistent hashing, virtual shards

**Operational Complexity:**

- **Monitoring**: Multiple databases to monitor and tune
- **Backup and recovery**: Coordinated across shards
- **Schema changes**: Deploy changes across all shards
- **Performance tuning**: Per-shard optimization needed

- Data storage strategy defined (databases, caching, file storage)
- API design covers all functional requirements
- Architecture can scale to meet non-functional requirements
- Data flow through the system is clear and logical
- Technology choices are appropriate for requirements and constraints
- Architecture diagram shows component relationships accurately
- Key architectural patterns are identified and justified
- Interviewer understands and agrees with the overall approach

### Common High-Level Design Mistakes

- **Over-engineering**: Adding unnecessary complexity without clear requirements
- **Under-specifying communication**: Vague component interaction definitions
- **Ignoring data consistency**: Not addressing how data stays consistent across components
- **Missing scalability planning**: Not designing for expected growth and load
- **Technology first**: Choosing technologies before understanding requirements
- **Monolithic thinking**: Not considering how components can evolve independently
- **Ignoring failure scenarios**: Not planning for component failures and recovery

### Interview Tips

**Effective Approach:**

- Start with user journey and trace through the system
- Explain your reasoning for each major component
- Call out important trade-offs and alternative approaches
- Ask for feedback before diving into detailed design
- Keep the big picture visible while explaining details

**Red Flags:**

- Jumping into implementation details too early
- Not explaining the reasoning behind component choices
- Ignoring the communication between components
- Not considering how the system will scale
- Making the design too complex for the given requirements

> **Remember**: The high-level design should be complete enough to guide detailed discussions but flexible enough to evolve. Focus on the big picture and major architectural decisions rather than implementation specifics. Your goal is to create a solid foundation that can support the detailed design phase.
