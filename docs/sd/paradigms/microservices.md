# Microservices Architecture

*An architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services that communicate over well-defined APIs.*

#### Overview

Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small, autonomous services that are organized around business capabilities. Each service is owned by a small team and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Business Capability Focus**: Services organized around business functions
- **Decentralized**: Independent teams, databases, and deployments
- **Technology Agnostic**: Each service can use different tech stacks
- **Failure Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade across the system
- **Evolutionary Design**: Services can evolve independently

#### When Microservices Make Sense

- **Large organizations** (> 20 developers) with multiple teams
- **Complex domains** with distinct business capabilities
- **Independent scaling** requirements across features
- **Technology diversity** needs
- **High deployment frequency** requirements
- **Strong DevOps culture** and operational expertise

#### When to Avoid Microservices

- **Small teams** (< 10 developers)
- **Simple, well-defined domains**
- **Limited operational expertise**
- **Strong consistency requirements** across all operations
- **Prototype or MVP** development
- **Monolith-first approach** often recommended

## Service Decomposition Strategies

#### What is Service Decomposition?

The process of breaking down a monolithic application or designing a new system as independent services, each responsible for specific business capabilities.

### Decomposition Approaches

#### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Bounded Contexts** as service boundaries:

```
E-commerce Domain Decomposition:
├── User Management (Identity & Access)
│   ├── User registration/authentication
│   ├── Profile management
│   └── Access control
├── Product Catalog (Product Information)
│   ├── Product information
│   ├── Categories and search
│   └── Inventory tracking
├── Order Management (Order Processing)
│   ├── Shopping cart
│   ├── Order placement
│   └── Order tracking
├── Payment Processing (Financial Transactions)
│   ├── Payment methods
│   ├── Transaction processing
│   └── Refunds and billing
└── Shipping & Fulfillment (Logistics)
    ├── Shipping calculation
    ├── Delivery tracking
    └── Warehouse management
```

#### Business Capability Decomposition

```
Identify Core Business Capabilities:
├── Customer-facing capabilities
│   ├── Product discovery
│   ├── Order placement
│   └── Customer support
├── Operational capabilities  
│   ├── Inventory management
│   ├── Order fulfillment
│   └── Supplier management
└── Support capabilities
    ├── Analytics and reporting
    ├── Notification services
    └── Audit and compliance
```

#### Data Ownership Decomposition

```python
# Each service owns its data completely
User Service:
├── users table
├── user_profiles table
└── user_preferences table

Product Service:
├── products table
├── categories table
└── product_reviews table

Order Service:
├── orders table
├── order_items table
└── order_status_history table

# No shared database access between services
```

### Decomposition Patterns

#### Strangler Fig Pattern

Gradually replace monolith functionality:

```
Legacy Monolith Decomposition Timeline:
Month 1-2: Extract User Service
├── Route /api/users/* to new User Service
├── Keep authentication in monolith temporarily
└── Migrate user data to separate database

Month 3-4: Extract Product Service  
├── Route /api/products/* to new Product Service
├── Handle product data migration
└── Update order service integration

Month 5-6: Extract Order Service
├── Most complex due to dependencies
├── Implement saga pattern for order processing
└── Update all service integrations
```

#### Branch by Abstraction

```python
# Create abstraction layer during decomposition
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process_payment(self, payment_data):
        if feature_flag.is_enabled("new_payment_service"):
            return self.new_payment_service.process(payment_data)
        else:
            return self.legacy_payment_module.process(payment_data)
```

#### Database Per Service

```
Service Database Patterns:
├── User Service → PostgreSQL (relational user data)
├── Product Service → MongoDB (flexible product catalog)
├── Order Service → PostgreSQL (transactional data)
├── Analytics Service → ClickHouse (time-series data)
└── Notification Service → Redis (temporary message storage)
```

### Service Sizing Guidelines

#### Microservice Size Principles

```
Size Indicators:
├── Team Size: 2-8 developers (Amazon's "two-pizza team")
├── Codebase: 10k-50k lines of code
├── Development Time: Rewrite in 2-4 weeks
├── Cognitive Load: One person can understand entire service
└── Business Capability: Single, well-defined responsibility
```

#### Anti-patterns to Avoid

```
Too Small (Nano-services):
├── Single function per service
├── Excessive network overhead
├── Operational complexity exceeds benefits
└── Distributed monolith behavior

Too Large (Mini-monoliths):
├── Multiple business capabilities
├── Multiple teams working on same service
├── Difficulty in independent deployment
└── Complex internal architecture
```

### Decomposition Best Practices

#### Start with Monolith

```
Recommended Evolution Path:
1. Start with well-structured monolith
2. Identify service boundaries through usage patterns
3. Extract services incrementally (highest value first)
4. Learn and improve with each extraction
5. Avoid "big bang" decomposition
```

#### Service Boundary Identification

```python
# Analyze data flow and dependencies
def analyze_service_boundaries():
    coupling_indicators = {
        "high_cohesion": [
            "functions_that_change_together",
            "shared_data_structures", 
            "related_business_rules"
        ],
        "low_coupling": [
            "independent_business_capabilities",
            "different_change_frequencies",
            "minimal_data_sharing"
        ]
    }
    
    # Look for natural boundaries:
    # - Different teams owning different features
    # - Different scaling requirements
    # - Different technology needs
    # - Different data models
```

------

## Data Consistency Across Services

#### The Challenge of Distributed Data

In microservices, each service owns its data, making traditional ACID transactions across services impossible. This creates challenges for maintaining consistency across the system.

### Consistency Models

#### Eventual Consistency

```
Order Processing Example:
1. Order Service creates order (status: PENDING)
2. Payment Service processes payment (async)
3. Order Service updates order (status: CONFIRMED)
4. Inventory Service reserves items (async)
5. Order Service updates order (status: RESERVED)

Timeline:
T0: Order created (PENDING)
T1: Payment processed (but order still PENDING)
T2: Order updated (CONFIRMED)  
T3: Inventory reserved (RESERVED)

System is eventually consistent, not immediately consistent
```

#### Strong Consistency Patterns

```python
# Two-Phase Commit (2PC) - Generally avoided in microservices
class TwoPhaseCommitCoordinator:
    def execute_transaction(self, operations):
        # Phase 1: Prepare
        prepared_services = []
        for service, operation in operations:
            if service.prepare(operation):
                prepared_services.append(service)
            else:
                # Abort all prepared services
                for prepared in prepared_services:
                    prepared.abort()
                return False
        
        # Phase 2: Commit
        for service in prepared_services:
            service.commit()
        return True

# Problems with 2PC:
# - Blocking protocol (coordinator failure blocks all)
# - Network partitions cause issues
# - Performance overhead
# - Not suitable for microservices
```

### Saga Pattern

Manages distributed transactions as a sequence of local transactions, with compensating actions for rollback.

#### Choreography-based Saga

```
Order Saga Choreography:
1. Order Service: Create order → Publishes OrderCreated event
2. Payment Service: Listens → Process payment → Publishes PaymentCompleted
3. Inventory Service: Listens → Reserve items → Publishes ItemsReserved  
4. Shipping Service: Listens → Schedule shipping → Publishes ShippingScheduled

Compensation Flow (if inventory fails):
1. Inventory Service: Publishes ItemReservationFailed
2. Payment Service: Listens → Refund payment → Publishes PaymentRefunded
3. Order Service: Listens → Cancel order → Publishes OrderCancelled
```

#### Orchestration-based Saga

```python
# Centralized saga orchestrator
class OrderSagaOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.steps = [
            ("create_order", "cancel_order"),
            ("process_payment", "refund_payment"),
            ("reserve_inventory", "release_inventory"), 
            ("schedule_shipping", "cancel_shipping")
        ]
    
    def execute_order_saga(self, order_data):
        completed_steps = []
        
        try:
            for step, compensation in self.steps:
                result = self.execute_step(step, order_data)
                completed_steps.append((step, compensation, result))
                
                if not result.success:
                    raise SagaStepFailedException(step)
                    
            return SagaResult(success=True)
            
        except SagaStepFailedException:
            # Execute compensations in reverse order
            for step, compensation, result in reversed(completed_steps):
                self.execute_compensation(compensation, result.data)
            
            return SagaResult(success=False)
```

#### Saga Pattern Comparison

| Aspect               | Choreography | Orchestration  |
| -------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| **Coupling**         | Low          | Higher         |
| **Complexity**       | Distributed  | Centralized    |
| **Debugging**        | Harder       | Easier         |
| **Failure Handling** | Complex      | Simpler        |
| **Performance**      | Better       | Slightly worse |

### Event Sourcing Pattern

Store all changes as a sequence of events, allowing reconstruction of current state.

```python
# Event sourcing for order aggregate
class OrderEvents:
    @dataclass
    class OrderCreated:
        order_id: str
        user_id: str
        items: List[OrderItem]
        timestamp: datetime
    
    @dataclass  
    class PaymentProcessed:
        order_id: str
        payment_id: str
        amount: Decimal
        timestamp: datetime
    
    @dataclass
    class OrderShipped:
        order_id: str
        tracking_number: str
        timestamp: datetime

class OrderAggregate:
    def __init__(self, order_id):
        self.order_id = order_id
        self.status = None
        self.items = []
        self.payment_id = None
        
    def apply_event(self, event):
        if isinstance(event, OrderEvents.OrderCreated):
            self.status = "CREATED"
            self.items = event.items
        elif isinstance(event, OrderEvents.PaymentProcessed):
            self.status = "PAID"
            self.payment_id = event.payment_id
        elif isinstance(event, OrderEvents.OrderShipped):
            self.status = "SHIPPED"
    
    @classmethod
    def from_events(cls, order_id, events):
        aggregate = cls(order_id)
        for event in events:
            aggregate.apply_event(event)
        return aggregate
```

### Data Synchronization Patterns

#### Event-Driven Data Sync

```
Data Synchronization Flow:
1. User Service updates user profile
2. Publishes UserProfileUpdated event  
3. Order Service listens and updates local user cache
4. Analytics Service listens and updates user dimension
5. Recommendation Service listens and refreshes user model

Benefits:
├── Near real-time synchronization
├── Loose coupling between services
├── Audit trail of all changes
└── Support for multiple consumers
```

#### Polling-based Sync

```python
# Periodic data synchronization
class DataSyncService:
    def __init__(self, sync_interval=300):  # 5 minutes
        self.sync_interval = sync_interval
        
    async def sync_user_data(self):
        # Get latest user updates
        last_sync = self.get_last_sync_timestamp()
        updated_users = await self.user_service.get_updated_users(since=last_sync)
        
        # Update local cache/database
        for user in updated_users:
            await self.update_local_user_data(user)
        
        self.update_last_sync_timestamp(datetime.now())

# Trade-offs:
# Pros: Simple, predictable
# Cons: Latency, resource usage, potential for conflicts
```

### Distributed Transaction Alternatives

#### Outbox Pattern

```python
# Ensure message publishing with database updates
class OrderService:
    def create_order(self, order_data):
        with database.transaction():
            # 1. Create order in database
            order = self.order_repository.create(order_data)
            
            # 2. Create outbox event in same transaction
            outbox_event = OutboxEvent(
                event_type="OrderCreated",
                payload=order.to_dict(),
                timestamp=datetime.now()
            )
            self.outbox_repository.create(outbox_event)
        
        # 3. Separate process publishes events from outbox
        return order

class OutboxPublisher:
    def publish_pending_events(self):
        pending_events = self.outbox_repository.get_pending_events()
        
        for event in pending_events:
            try:
                self.message_broker.publish(event.payload)
                self.outbox_repository.mark_published(event.id)
            except Exception as e:
                # Retry logic here
                pass
```

#### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

```
CQRS Pattern:
├── Command Side (Writes)
│   ├── Handles business operations
│   ├── Updates normalized data store
│   └── Publishes events
└── Query Side (Reads)  
    ├── Handles read requests
    ├── Uses denormalized views
    └── Optimized for queries

Benefits:
├── Independent scaling of reads/writes
├── Optimized data models for different use cases
├── Event sourcing compatibility
└── Improved performance
```

## Inter-service Communication Patterns

### Communication Styles

Microservices communicate through network calls, requiring careful consideration of communication patterns, protocols, and failure handling.

### Synchronous Communication

#### HTTP/REST APIs

```python
# REST API communication between services
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, user_service_client, product_service_client):
        self.user_service = user_service_client
        self.product_service = product_service_client
    
    async def create_order(self, order_request):
        # Synchronous calls to other services
        user = await self.user_service.get_user(order_request.user_id)
        if not user.is_active:
            raise UserNotActiveError()
        
        products = await self.product_service.get_products(order_request.item_ids)
        if not all(p.available for p in products):
            raise ProductNotAvailableError()
        
        # Create order with validated data
        return self.create_order_record(order_request, user, products)
```

#### gRPC Communication

```protobuf
// user_service.proto
service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
  rpc ValidateUser(ValidateUserRequest) returns (ValidationResponse);
}

message GetUserRequest {
  string user_id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  string user_id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
  bool is_active = 4;
}
```

#### GraphQL Federation

```graphql
# User service schema
type User @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

# Order service schema  
type Order @key(fields: "id") {
  id: ID!
  user: User!  # Reference to User from User service
  items: [OrderItem!]!
  total: Float!
}

# Gateway automatically federates the schemas
```

### Asynchronous Communication

#### Message Queues

```python
# Point-to-point messaging
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self, message_queue):
        self.queue = message_queue
        
    def process_order(self, order):
        # Add order to processing queue
        message = {
            "order_id": order.id,
            "user_id": order.user_id,
            "items": order.items,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
        
        self.queue.send_message("order-processing-queue", message)

class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, message_queue):
        self.queue = message_queue
        
    def start_processing(self):
        # Listen for messages
        self.queue.listen("order-processing-queue", self.handle_order)
        
    def handle_order(self, message):
        order_data = json.loads(message.body)
        # Process payment for order
        payment_result = self.process_payment(order_data)
        
        # Send result to next queue
        if payment_result.success:
            self.queue.send_message("order-fulfillment-queue", order_data)
        else:
            self.queue.send_message("order-failed-queue", order_data)
```

#### Event Streaming

```python
# Kafka event streaming
class EventStreamingExample:
    def __init__(self, kafka_producer, kafka_consumer):
        self.producer = kafka_producer
        self.consumer = kafka_consumer
    
    def publish_order_event(self, order):
        event = {
            "event_type": "OrderCreated",
            "order_id": order.id,
            "user_id": order.user_id,
            "total": float(order.total),
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
        
        # Publish to Kafka topic
        self.producer.send("order-events", value=event)
    
    def consume_order_events(self):
        # Multiple services can consume the same event stream
        for message in self.consumer:
            event = message.value
            
            if event["event_type"] == "OrderCreated":
                self.handle_order_created(event)
```

### 3.3 Communication Patterns

#### Request-Response Pattern

```
Synchronous Request-Response:
Client → API Gateway → Service A → Service B → Database
                          ↓           ↓         ↓
                       Response ← Response ← Result

Characteristics:
├── Immediate response required
├── Strong consistency needed  
├── Simple error handling
└── Higher coupling between services
```

#### Fire-and-Forget Pattern

```
Asynchronous Fire-and-Forget:
Service A → Message Queue → Service B
         ↓
    Continue Processing

Use Cases:
├── Audit logging
├── Analytics events
├── Notification sending
└── Background processing
```

#### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

```
Event Publishing:
Service A → Event Bus → [Service B, Service C, Service D]

Benefits:
├── Low coupling between services
├── Easy to add new consumers
├── Scalable event processing
└── Supports eventual consistency
```

### Communication Best Practices

#### API Versioning Strategies

- **URL-based versioning**: `/api/v1/users` vs `/api/v2/users`
- **Header-based versioning**: `API-Version: 2` in request headers
- **Semantic versioning**: For backward compatibility guarantees
- **Deprecation timeline**: Clear communication about version lifecycle

#### Circuit Breaker for Service Calls

Prevents cascading failures by monitoring service health:

- **Closed State**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open State**: Service failing, requests rejected immediately
- **Half-Open State**: Testing if service recovered

Key Configuration:

- Failure threshold (e.g., 5 consecutive failures)
- Timeout period (e.g., 60 seconds before retry)
- Success threshold for closing (e.g., 3 successful calls)

#### Timeout and Retry Strategies

**Timeout Configuration**:

- Connection timeout: 5 seconds
- Read timeout: 30 seconds for normal operations
- Different timeouts for different service types

**Retry Patterns**:

- **Exponential backoff**: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s intervals
- **Retry conditions**: Only retry on transient failures (5xx errors, timeouts)
- **Maximum attempts**: Typically 3-5 retries
- **Jitter**: Add randomness to prevent thundering herd

## Service Mesh Architecture

#### What is Service Mesh?

A dedicated infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication, providing features like load balancing, service discovery, security, and observability without requiring changes to application code.

### Service Mesh Components

#### Data Plane

```
Service Mesh Data Plane:
Service A ←→ Sidecar Proxy ←→ Network ←→ Sidecar Proxy ←→ Service B

Sidecar Proxy Responsibilities:
├── Load balancing
├── Health checking  
├── Circuit breaking
├── Retries and timeouts
├── TLS termination
├── Metrics collection
└── Traffic routing
```

#### Control Plane

```
Service Mesh Control Plane:
├── Service Discovery (Registry of all services)
├── Configuration Management (Routing rules, policies)
├── Certificate Management (mTLS certificates)
├── Policy Enforcement (Access control, rate limiting)
└── Telemetry Collection (Metrics, traces, logs)
```

### Service Mesh Benefits

#### Traffic Management

```yaml
# Example: Istio traffic management
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        user-type:
          exact: premium
    route:
    - destination:
        host: user-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 100
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: user-service  
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: user-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```

#### Security Features

```yaml
# Automatic mTLS between services
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT  # Require mTLS for all communication

# Authorization policies
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: order-service-policy
spec:
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/default/sa/api-gateway"]
  - to:
    - operation:
        methods: ["POST", "GET"]
```

#### Observability

```
Service Mesh Observability:
├── Automatic metrics collection (latency, throughput, errors)
├── Distributed tracing (request path across services)
├── Access logs (all service-to-service communication)
└── Service topology visualization
```

### Service Mesh Patterns

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

```yaml
# Istio circuit breaker configuration
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  host: payment-service
  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 3
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
      maxEjectionPercent: 50
      minHealthPercent: 50
```

#### Canary Deployments

```yaml
# Progressive traffic shifting
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: canary-deployment
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: user-service
        subset: canary
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: user-service
        subset: stable
      weight: 95
    - destination:

```

### Service Mesh Trade-offs

#### Benefits

- **Zero-code observability**: Automatic metrics and tracing
- **Security by default**: mTLS and policy enforcement
- **Traffic management**: Advanced routing and load balancing
- **Operational consistency**: Standardized patterns across services

#### Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure to manage
- **Performance overhead**: Proxy adds latency (1-10ms)
- **Learning curve**: New concepts and configuration
- **Vendor lock-in**: Platform-specific features

#### When to Use Service Mesh

```
Consider Service Mesh When:
├── 10+ microservices
├── Complex networking requirements
├── Strong security requirements
├── Need advanced traffic management
└── Multiple teams/languages

Avoid Service Mesh When:
├── Simple microservices architecture
├── Performance is critical (latency sensitive)
├── Limited operational expertise
└── Cost is a major concern
```

## Microservices Implementation Best Practices

### Service Design Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle

**Good Service Design**:

- Focused on one business capability
- Clear, well-defined responsibility
- Minimal external dependencies
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Poor Service Design (Avoid)**:

- Multiple unrelated responsibilities
- Complex internal architecture
- Many external dependencies
- Requires multiple teams to maintain

#### API-First Design

```yaml
# OpenAPI specification first, then implementation
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: User Service API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      summary: Get user by ID
      parameters:
        - name: userId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: User found
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
        '404':
          description: User not found
```

### Data Management

#### Database Per Service

```
Service Data Ownership:
├── User Service → PostgreSQL (user data)
├── Product Service → MongoDB (product catalog)  
├── Order Service → PostgreSQL (transactional data)
├── Analytics Service → ClickHouse (events)
└── Search Service → Elasticsearch (indexed data)

No cross-service database access allowed
```

#### Event-Driven Data Synchronization

When data changes in one service, events are published for other services to consume:

**Event Publishing**: Service publishes events when data changes

- UserProfileUpdated, OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed
- Include necessary data in event payload
- Use consistent event schemas across organization

**Event Consumption**: Other services subscribe to relevant events

- Update local caches or read models
- Trigger business processes
- Maintain data consistency across services

### Testing Strategies

#### Testing Pyramid for Microservices

```
Testing Pyramid:
                    E2E Tests
                  (Expensive, Slow)
                /                \
            Integration Tests
          (Moderate Cost/Speed)
          /                    \
    Unit Tests              Contract Tests
  (Fast, Cheap)           (API Contracts)
```

#### Contract Testing

Ensures service compatibility without running all services:

**Consumer-Driven Contracts**:

- Consumer defines expected API behavior
- Provider verifies it can meet the contract
- Catches breaking changes early
- Tools: Pact, Spring Cloud Contract

**Benefits**:

- Independent service development
- Faster feedback on breaking changes
- Better API design collaboration
- Reduced integration testing overhead

### Deployment and Operations

#### Independent Deployments

```yaml
# Each service has its own CI/CD pipeline
# user-service-pipeline.yml
stages:
  - test:
      - unit_tests
      - integration_tests
      - contract_tests
  - build:
      - docker_build
      - security_scan
  - deploy:
      - staging_deployment
      - automated_tests
      - production_deployment
      - health_checks

# Independent versioning
services:
  - user-service: v2.3.1
  - product-service: v1.8.2  
  - order-service: v3.1.0
  - payment-service: v1.5.4
```

#### Service Discovery Patterns

**Service Registry**: Central location where services register and discover each other

- Services register their location (host, port, health check URL)
- Clients query registry to find service instances
- Health checking removes unhealthy instances
- Examples: Consul, Eureka, etcd

**Client-Side Discovery**: Client queries registry and chooses instance

- Lower latency (no extra network hop)
- Client controls load balancing
- More complex client implementation

**Server-Side Discovery**: Load balancer queries registry

- Simpler client implementation
- Centralized load balancing logic
- Additional network hop

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Distributed Tracing Implementation

**Trace Context Propagation**:

- Extract trace context from incoming requests
- Start new span for current service operation
- Inject trace context into outgoing requests
- Use correlation IDs to track requests across services

**Key Benefits**:

- Visualize request flow across services
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Debug distributed system issues
- Monitor service dependencies

#### Service Health Monitoring

**Comprehensive Health Checks**:

- **Shallow checks**: Basic connectivity and resource availability
- **Deep checks**: External dependency health and functionality
- **Business logic checks**: End-to-end workflow validation

**Health Check Levels**:

- `/health/live`: Liveness probe (restart if failing)
- `/health/ready`: Readiness probe (remove from load balancer)
- `/health/detailed`: Comprehensive status for debugging

**Monitoring Strategy**:

- Different timeouts for different check types
- Graceful degradation when dependencies are unhealthy
- Clear status reporting (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)

## Migration Strategies

### Monolith to Microservices Migration

#### Assessment Phase

**Monolith Analysis Factors**:

- **Codebase size**: Lines of code, module count, complexity
- **Team structure**: Number of teams, ownership boundaries
- **Coupling analysis**: Dependencies between modules
- **Change patterns**: Which parts change together frequently
- **Deployment metrics**: Frequency, lead time, failure rate

**Readiness Indicators**:

- Large codebase (> 100k LOC) with clear module boundaries
- Multiple teams working on different business areas
- Different scaling requirements across features
- Need for technology diversity
- High deployment frequency requirements

#### Incremental Migration Strategy

```
Migration Phases:
Phase 1: Extract Edge Services (3-6 months)
├── Authentication service
├── Notification service  
├── File upload service
└── Static content service

Phase 2: Extract Core Services (6-12 months)
├── User management service
├── Product catalog service
├── Search service
└── Analytics service

Phase 3: Extract Transaction Services (12-18 months)
├── Order processing service
├── Payment processing service
├── Inventory management service
└── Shipping service

Phase 4: Decompose Remaining Monolith (18-24 months)
├── Advanced analytics
├── Reporting services
├── Admin services
└── Legacy feature services
```

### Migration Patterns

#### Strangler Fig Pattern Implementation

**Gradual Replacement Strategy**:

- Route traffic between old and new systems using feature flags
- Start with edge services (lower risk, fewer dependencies)
- Gradually increase traffic percentage to new services
- Monitor performance and rollback if issues occur

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create routing layer with feature flags
2. Implement new service alongside existing functionality
3. Start with small percentage of traffic (5-10%)
4. Monitor metrics and gradually increase percentage
5. Remove old functionality once migration is complete

#### Database Decomposition Strategy

```sql
-- Phase 1: Separate schemas within same database
CREATE SCHEMA user_service;
CREATE SCHEMA product_service;
CREATE SCHEMA order_service;

-- Migrate tables to appropriate schemas
ALTER TABLE users SET SCHEMA user_service;
ALTER TABLE products SET SCHEMA product_service;
ALTER TABLE orders SET SCHEMA order_service;

-- Phase 2: Create views for cross-schema dependencies
CREATE VIEW order_service.user_summary AS
SELECT user_id, name, email, status 
FROM user_service.users;

-- Phase 3: Replace views with service calls
-- Remove view, implement API call in application code

-- Phase 4: Split into separate databases
-- Export schemas to separate database instances
```
