# Event-Driven Architecture

*An architectural pattern where components communicate through the production and consumption of events, enabling loose coupling, scalability, and reactive systems.*

#### Overview

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. Systems react to events as they occur, enabling real-time processing and responsive applications.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Event-centric communication**: Components interact through events
- **Loose coupling**: Producers and consumers are independent
- **Asynchronous processing**: Non-blocking event handling
- **Reactive systems**: Respond to changes in real-time
- **Scalable design**: Components scale independently

#### Core Concepts

- **Event**: A significant change in state or occurrence
- **Event Producer**: Component that generates events
- **Event Consumer**: Component that reacts to events
- **Event Broker**: Middleware that routes events
- **Event Store**: Persistent storage for events

#### When EDA Makes Sense

- **Real-time systems**: Trading platforms, monitoring systems
- **Microservices architectures**: Loose coupling between services
- **Integration scenarios**: Connecting disparate systems
- **Scalable applications**: Variable load and high throughput
- **Audit and compliance**: Complete event history required
- **Complex business processes**: Multi-step workflows

#### When to Avoid EDA

- **Simple CRUD applications**: Straightforward data operations
- **Strong consistency requirements**: Immediate consistency needed
- **Small, monolithic systems**: Low complexity applications
- **Limited team expertise**: Complex debugging and monitoring
- **Synchronous workflows**: Sequential processing requirements

## Event Sourcing

### What is Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing is a pattern where changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events. Instead of storing current state, the system stores all events that led to the current state, allowing for complete reconstruction and audit trails.

### Event Sourcing Concepts

#### Event Store as Source of Truth

```
Traditional Approach:
Database Tables → Current State Only
├── User: {id: 123, name: "John", email: "john@email.com", status: "active"}
└── Order: {id: 456, status: "shipped", total: 99.99}

Event Sourcing Approach:
Event Stream → Complete History
├── UserCreated {userId: 123, name: "John", email: "john@email.com"}
├── UserEmailUpdated {userId: 123, newEmail: "john.doe@email.com"}
├── OrderPlaced {orderId: 456, userId: 123, items: [...], total: 99.99}
├── PaymentProcessed {orderId: 456, amount: 99.99, method: "card"}
└── OrderShipped {orderId: 456, trackingNumber: "ABC123"}
```

#### Event Immutability

```
Event Characteristics:
├── Immutable: Events never change once written
├── Append-only: New events added, existing ones never modified
├── Timestamped: Each event has occurrence time
├── Versioned: Events have schema versions for evolution
└── Causally ordered: Events maintain causal relationships
```

#### Event Replay and Reconstruction

```
State Reconstruction Process:
1. Start with empty state
2. Read events from beginning
3. Apply each event to current state
4. Final state represents current system state

Benefits:
├── Complete audit trail
├── Point-in-time reconstruction
├── Debugging capabilities
├── Business intelligence insights
└── Regulatory compliance
```

### Event Sourcing Implementation Patterns

#### Aggregate Design

```
Aggregate Root Pattern:
├── Aggregate boundary defines consistency
├── Events generated within aggregate
├── Business rules enforced at aggregate level
├── State changes through event application
└── External communication via events

Example - Order Aggregate:
├── OrderCreated → Initial state
├── ItemAdded → Update items list
├── PaymentProcessed → Update payment status
├── OrderShipped → Update shipping status
└── OrderCancelled → Update order status
```

#### Event Store Design

```
Event Store Components:
├── Event Stream: Ordered sequence of events for entity
├── Event Metadata: Version, timestamp, causation ID
├── Snapshots: Periodic state captures for performance
├── Event Bus: Publishes events to external consumers
└── Projections: Read models derived from events

Storage Considerations:
├── Partitioning: By aggregate ID or stream
├── Indexing: Event type, timestamp, aggregate ID
├── Compression: Reduce storage costs
├── Retention: Archive old events
└── Performance: Optimize for append operations
```

#### Snapshot Optimization

```
Snapshot Strategy:
├── Purpose: Avoid replaying entire event history
├── Frequency: Every N events or time interval
├── Storage: Separate snapshot store
├── Restoration: Load snapshot + subsequent events
└── Cleanup: Remove events before snapshot

Snapshot Considerations:
├── Performance vs Storage trade-off
├── Backward compatibility of snapshots
├── Snapshot versioning
├── Consistency between snapshots and events
└── Recovery procedures
```

### Event Sourcing Benefits

#### Complete Audit Trail

```
Audit Capabilities:
├── Who: User/system that triggered event
├── What: Exact change that occurred
├── When: Precise timestamp
├── Why: Business context and causation
└── How: Sequence of events leading to state

Compliance Benefits:
├── Regulatory reporting
├── Financial auditing
├── Security investigations
├── Performance analysis
└── Business intelligence
```

#### Temporal Queries

```
Time-based Analysis:
├── Point-in-time reconstruction: "What was the state at 3 PM yesterday?"
├── Trend analysis: "How did user behavior change over time?"
├── Comparison: "Compare current vs previous month performance"
├── Projection: "Predict future based on historical patterns"
└── Debugging: "What sequence of events led to this bug?"
```

### Event Sourcing Challenges

#### Complexity Overhead

## CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### What is CQRS?

CQRS is a pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. Commands perform updates and queries perform reads, often using different models optimized for their specific use cases.

### CQRS Fundamentals

#### Command and Query Separation

```
Traditional Approach:
Client → Single Model → Database
  ↓         ↓           ↓
Reads/Writes  Shared Model  Same Schema

CQRS Approach:
Commands → Write Model → Write Database
Queries ← Read Model ← Read Database
            ↑              ↑
      Optimized for    Optimized for
      writes/business   reads/queries

## Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

### What is the Saga Pattern?

The Saga pattern manages distributed transactions by breaking them into a series of local transactions, each with a compensating action to undo its effect if the overall transaction fails.

### Saga Fundamentals

#### Distributed Transaction Challenge

```
Traditional Distributed Transaction:
Service A → Begin Transaction
Service B → Join Transaction  
Service C → Join Transaction
All Services → Commit/Rollback Together

Problems:
├── Two-phase commit complexity
├── Blocking protocol limitations
├── Failure recovery challenges
├── Performance overhead
└── Scalability issues
```

#### Saga Solution Approach

```
Saga Transaction:
Step 1: Service A → Local Transaction + Compensating Action
Step 2: Service B → Local Transaction + Compensating Action  
Step 3: Service C → Local Transaction + Compensating Action

If any step fails:
Execute compensating actions in reverse order
```

#### Saga Properties

```
Saga Characteristics:
├── Atomicity: All steps complete or all compensated
├── Consistency: Business rules maintained
├── Isolation: Limited isolation guarantees
├── Durability: Each step is durable
└── Compensation: Rollback through compensating actions
```

### Saga Implementation Patterns

#### Choreography-based Saga

```
Choreography Pattern:
├── Decentralized coordination
├── Each service knows next step
├── Event-driven communication
├── No central coordinator
└── Services react to events

Order Processing Example:
1. Order Service: Create order → Publishes OrderCreated
2. Payment Service: Process payment → Publishes PaymentProcessed  
3. Inventory Service: Reserve items → Publishes ItemsReserved
4. Shipping Service: Schedule shipping → Publishes ShippingScheduled

Failure Handling:
1. Inventory Service: Publishes ItemReservationFailed
2. Payment Service: Receives event → Refunds payment
3. Order Service: Receives event → Cancels order
```

#### Orchestration-based Saga

```
Orchestration Pattern:
├── Centralized coordination
├── Saga orchestrator manages flow
├── Direct service communication
├── Central decision making
└── Explicit state management

Order Processing Example:
Saga Orchestrator:
1. Calls Order Service → Create order
2. Calls Payment Service → Process payment
3. Calls Inventory Service → Reserve items  
4. Calls Shipping Service → Schedule shipping

If step 3 fails:
1. Calls Payment Service → Refund payment
2. Calls Order Service → Cancel order
```

#### Saga Pattern Comparison

| Aspect          | Choreography | Orchestration   |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| **Coupling**    | Lower        | Higher          |
| **Complexity**  | Distributed  | Centralized     |
| **Debugging**   | Harder       | Easier          |
| **Performance** | Better       | Overhead        |
| **Governance**  | Difficult    | Easier          |
| **Scalability** | Better       | Bottleneck risk |

### Compensating Actions

```
Compensation Requirements:
├── Semantic rollback: Business-level undo
├── Idempotent: Safe to execute multiple times  
├── Retryable: Handle temporary failures
├── Loosely coupled: Independent of other compensations
└── Business-aware: Understand domain implications

Example Compensations:
├── CreateOrder → CancelOrder
├── ChargePayment → RefundPayment
├── ReserveInventory → ReleaseInventory
├── SendEmail → SendCancellationEmail
└── AllocateResources → DeallocateResources
```

#### Compensation Challenges

```
Design Challenges:
├── Irreversible actions: Some operations cannot be undone
├── Partial failures: What if compensation fails?
├── Timing issues: Long-running compensations
├── State visibility: Knowing when to compensate
└── Business rules: Complex compensation logic

Solutions:
├── Design for compensability from start
├── Retry mechanisms for compensations
├── Manual intervention procedures
├── Comprehensive monitoring
└── Business process design
```

### Saga State Management

#### Saga Execution Context

```
Saga State Components:
├── Saga ID: Unique transaction identifier
├── Current step: Which step is executing
├── Completed steps: What has been done
├── Compensation data: Information for rollback
├── Status: Running, completed, failed, compensating
└── Metadata: Timestamps, retry counts, etc.

State Persistence:
├── Database: Transactional storage
├── Event store: Event-sourced saga state
├── In-memory: For short-lived sagas
├── Distributed cache: For performance
└── Hybrid: Combination based on needs
```

#### Error Handling and Recovery

```
Error Scenarios:
├── Step failure: Business logic error
├── Service unavailability: Temporary outage
├── Timeout: Step takes too long
├── Compensation failure: Rollback issues
└── Saga coordinator failure: Infrastructure issues

Recovery Strategies:
├── Retry with backoff: Automatic retry
├── Circuit breaker: Stop calling failing services
├── Manual intervention: Human oversight
├── Partial compensation: Best-effort rollback
└── Forward recovery: Complete saga differently
```

### Saga Implementation Best Practices

#### Saga Design Guidelines

```
Design Principles:
├── Design for failure: Assume steps will fail
├── Idempotent operations: Safe to retry
├── Minimize saga scope: Keep transactions focused
├── Timeout handling: Set reasonable timeouts
├── Monitoring: Track saga execution
└── Documentation: Clear compensation logic

Step Ordering:
├── Validate early: Check constraints first
├── Reserve resources: Hold what you need
├── Irreversible last: Do permanent changes late
├── Minimize compensation: Fewer steps to undo
└── Fast failure: Fail quickly when possible
```

#### Monitoring and Observability

#### Success Factors

- **Start incrementally**: Begin with simple event-driven patterns
- **Domain-driven approach**: Align events with business boundaries
- **Invest in tooling**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools
- **Team education**: Ensure team understands distributed system concepts
- **Operational readiness**: Prepare for increased operational complexity

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Event overuse**: Not every communication needs events
- **Insufficient monitoring**: Underestimating observability needs
- **Weak consistency handling**: Not planning for eventual consistency
- **Schema evolution neglect**: Poor planning for event schema changes
- **Complexity underestimation**: Underestimating distributed system complexity

Remember: Event-driven architecture is a powerful paradigm that enables highly scalable, loosely coupled systems. Success requires careful pattern selection, robust infrastructure, and team expertise in distributed systems. Start with simple patterns and evolve complexity based on actual needs and learning.
