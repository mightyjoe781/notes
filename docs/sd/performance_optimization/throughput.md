# Throughput Optimization

*Strategies and techniques to maximize the number of operations a system can handle per unit of time while maintaining acceptable performance.*

## Overview

Throughput optimization focuses on maximizing the volume of work a system can process within a given timeframe. Unlike latency optimization which focuses on individual request speed, throughput optimization aims to handle the maximum number of concurrent operations efficiently.

### Throughput vs Latency Trade-offs

**Key Relationships:**

- High throughput often increases latency
- Batch processing improves throughput but adds latency
- Connection reuse improves both throughput and latency
- Parallel processing can improve both with proper design
- Resource contention can hurt both throughput and latency

### Throughput Measurement

- **Requests per second (RPS)**: Web application throughput
- **Transactions per second (TPS)**: Database throughput
- **Messages per second**: Message queue throughput
- **Bytes per second**: Network and I/O throughput
- **Operations per second**: General system throughput

### Common Throughput Bottlenecks

- **CPU**: Computation-intensive operations
- **Memory**: Large datasets or memory leaks
- **I/O**: Disk reads/writes, network operations
- **Database**: Query processing, lock contention
- **Network**: Bandwidth limitations, connection limits

## Connection Pooling

### What is Connection Pooling?

Connection pooling maintains a pool of reusable database connections to eliminate the overhead of creating and destroying connections for each operation, significantly improving throughput.

### Connection Pool Fundamentals
