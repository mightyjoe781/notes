# Scalability Patterns

*Comprehensive guide to scalability patterns including Auto-scaling, Load Shedding, Rate Limiting, and Database Connection Pooling.*

## Overview

Scalability patterns are design patterns that enable systems to handle increasing loads by efficiently distributing work, managing resources, and maintaining performance as demand grows. These patterns are essential for building systems that can scale horizontally and vertically.

### Scalability Fundamentals

**Scalability Types:**

- **Horizontal scaling (Scale out)**: Add more servers to handle increased load
- **Vertical scaling (Scale up)**: Increase resources (CPU, memory) of existing servers
- **Elastic scaling**: Automatically adjust resources based on demand
- **Geographic scaling**: Distribute services across multiple regions

**Scalability Metrics:**

- **Requests per second (RPS)**: Number of requests system can handle
- **Concurrent users**: Number of simultaneous active users
- **Response time**: How response time changes with increased load
- **Resource utilization**: CPU, memory, network usage under load
- **Cost per transaction**: Economic efficiency of scaling

**Scalability Challenges:**

- **State management**: Handling stateful applications in distributed environments
- **Data consistency**: Maintaining consistency across scaled components
- **Load distribution**: Evenly distributing work across resources
- **Resource coordination**: Managing resources across multiple instances
- **Performance degradation**: Preventing performance loss during scaling

## Auto-scaling

### Auto-scaling Fundamentals

Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of computing resources allocated to an application based on current demand, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing costs.

### Auto-scaling Components

#### Scaling Triggers

**Metric-Based Triggers:**

- **CPU utilization**: Scale based on processor usage (e.g., >70% for 5 minutes)
- **Memory utilization**: Scale based on memory consumption
- **Request rate**: Scale based on incoming request volume
- **Response time**: Scale when response times exceed thresholds
- **Queue depth**: Scale based on message queue sizes

**Custom Metrics:**

- **Business metrics**: Active users, transactions per second
- **Application metrics**: Database connection pool usage, cache hit rates
- **External metrics**: Third-party service response times
- **Composite metrics**: Combination of multiple metrics for scaling decisions

#### Scaling Policies

**Target Tracking:**

```
Target Tracking Policy:
- Target: 70% CPU utilization
- Scale out: Add instances when CPU > 70%
- Scale in: Remove instances when CPU < 70%
- Cooldown: Wait 5 minutes between scaling actions

Benefits:
- Simple configuration
- Automatic adjustment
- Maintains target metric
- Built-in safeguards
```

**Step Scaling:**

```
Step Scaling Policy:
CPU 50-60%: No action
CPU 60-80%: Add 1 instance
CPU 80-90%: Add 2 instances
CPU >90%:   Add 3 instances

Benefits:
- Graduated response
- Handle sudden spikes
- Fine-grained control
- Prevent over-scaling
```

**Predictive Scaling:**

- **Historical patterns**: Scale based on historical usage patterns
- **Machine learning**: Use ML to predict future demand
- **Calendar-based**: Scale for known events (Black Friday, product launches)
- **External factors**: Scale based on external data (weather, events)

### Auto-scaling Strategies

#### Proactive vs Reactive Scaling

**Reactive Scaling:**

```

- Prevents performance degradation
- More complex implementation
- May over-provision resources
```

#### Scaling Velocity and Cooldowns

**Scale-Out Velocity:**

- **Aggressive scaling**: Quickly add many instances for rapid response
- **Conservative scaling**: Gradually add instances to avoid over-provisioning
- **Stepped scaling**: Add instances in predefined increments
- **Exponential scaling**: Increase scaling rate with severity of demand

**Cooldown Periods:**

## Load Shedding

### Load Shedding Fundamentals

Load shedding is a technique that intentionally drops or rejects requests when system capacity is exceeded, protecting core system functionality and preventing complete system failure.

### Load Shedding Strategies

#### Priority-Based Shedding

**Request Prioritization:**

```
Priority Levels:
├── Critical (P0): Essential system functions, admin operations
├── High (P1): Paying customers, core business features
├── Medium (P2): Standard users, important features
├── Low (P3): Free users, optional features
└── Best Effort (P4): Analytics, reporting, non-essential features

Shedding Strategy:
- Shed P4 requests first
- Then P3, P2, P1 in order
- Preserve P0 requests always
- Monitor and adjust thresholds
```

**User-Based Prioritization:**

- **Premium users**: Higher priority for paid subscribers
- **Geographic prioritization**: Priority based on user location
- **Session-based**: Priority for authenticated users
- **Behavioral**: Priority based on user engagement history

7. **Plan for failure scenarios**: Design scalability patterns to handle component failures gracefully

### Common Scalability Pattern Mistakes

- **Reactive-only auto-scaling**: Not implementing predictive scaling for known traffic patterns
- **Overly aggressive load shedding**: Shedding too much traffic, affecting user experience unnecessarily
- **Inconsistent rate limiting**: Applying different rate limiting strategies that conflict with each other
- **Static configuration**: Not adapting scalability parameters based on changing conditions
- **Ignoring cascade effects**: Not considering how scaling one component affects others
- **Poor monitoring**: Insufficient observability into scalability pattern effectiveness

> **Remember**: Scalability patterns must be designed holistically, considering the entire system architecture. Test scalability patterns under realistic load conditions and continuously monitor their effectiveness as system requirements evolve.
