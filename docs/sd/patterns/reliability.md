# Reliability Patterns

*Comprehensive guide to reliability patterns including Circuit Breaker, Retry with Exponential Backoff, Timeout Pattern, and Bulkhead Isolation.*

## Overview

Reliability patterns are design patterns that help systems handle failures gracefully, maintain availability, and provide consistent user experiences even when components fail. These patterns are essential for building resilient distributed systems.

### Reliability Fundamentals

**Key Reliability Concepts:**

- **Fault tolerance**: System continues operating despite component failures
- **Graceful degradation**: Reduced functionality rather than complete failure
- **Fast failure**: Fail quickly rather than hang indefinitely
- **Recovery**: Automatic return to normal operation when possible

**Failure Types:**

- **Transient failures**: Temporary network issues, resource exhaustion
- **Persistent failures**: Service outages, configuration errors
- **Cascading failures**: Failures that propagate through system components
- **Silent failures**: Errors that occur without obvious symptoms

**Reliability Metrics:**

- **Availability**: Percentage of time system is operational
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to restore service
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average time between failures
- **Error rate**: Percentage of requests that fail

## Circuit Breaker

### Circuit Breaker Fundamentals

The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by monitoring service calls and "opening" the circuit when failures exceed a threshold, allowing the system to fail fast and recover gracefully.

### Circuit Breaker States

#### Closed State (Normal Operation)

**Characteristics:**

- **All requests pass through**: Circuit allows normal operation
- **Failure monitoring**: Track success/failure rates
- **Threshold checking**: Monitor if failures exceed configured threshold
- **Performance impact**: Minimal overhead during normal operation

**State Transition:**

- **Trigger**: Failure rate exceeds threshold (e.g., >50% failures in 1 minute)
- **Action**: Transition to Open state
- **Metrics**: Track failure count, success count, response times

#### Open State (Circuit Breaker Activated)

**Characteristics:**

- **Block all requests**: Immediately fail without calling downstream service
- **Fast failure**: Return cached response or default value
- **Timeout period**: Wait for configured duration before testing recovery
- **Resource protection**: Prevent overwhelming failed service

**State Transition:**

- **Trigger**: Timeout period expires (e.g., 60 seconds)
- **Action**: Transition to Half-Open state
- **Response**: Return fallback response or error to callers

#### Half-Open State (Testing Recovery)

**Characteristics:**

- **Limited testing**: Allow small number of requests through
- **Success monitoring**: Monitor if test requests succeed
- **Quick decision**: Rapidly determine if service recovered
- **Gradual recovery**: Slowly increase traffic if successful

**State Transitions:**

- **Success**: Test requests succeed → Transition to Closed state
- **Failure**: Test requests fail → Return to Open state
- **Timeout**: No response within timeout → Return to Open state

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

#### Configuration Parameters

**Failure Thresholds:**

- **Failure rate threshold**: Percentage of failures to trigger opening (e.g., 50%)
- **Request volume threshold**: Minimum requests before evaluation (e.g., 20 requests)
- **Time window**: Period over which to evaluate failures (e.g., 1 minute)
- **Consecutive failures**: Number of consecutive failures to trigger (alternative approach)

**Timing Parameters:**

- **Timeout duration**: How long circuit stays open (e.g., 60 seconds)
- **Half-open success threshold**: Successful requests needed to close (e.g., 3 successes)
- **Half-open request limit**: Maximum requests in half-open state (e.g., 5 requests)
- **Reset timeout**: Time between recovery attempts

#### Monitoring and Metrics

**Circuit Breaker Metrics:**

- **State transitions**: Track when circuit opens/closes
- **Request counts**: Successful, failed, and blocked requests
- **Response times**: Latency distribution for successful requests
- **Circuit health**: Overall circuit breaker effectiveness

**Alerting:**

- **Circuit open alerts**: Notify when circuit breaker opens
- **Prolonged open state**: Alert if circuit stays open too long
- **Frequent state changes**: Alert on unstable circuit behavior
- **Performance degradation**: Alert on increasing failure rates

### Fallback Strategies

#### Fallback Response Types

**Cached Responses:**

- **Stale data**: Return previously cached successful responses
- **Default values**: Provide sensible default responses
- **Simplified responses**: Return reduced functionality responses
- **Empty responses**: Return empty but valid responses

**Alternative Services:**

- **Secondary service**: Route to backup service implementation
- **Read replicas**: Use read-only replicas for read operations
- **Degraded functionality**: Provide reduced feature set
- **Manual data**: Use manually curated fallback data

#### Fallback Implementation Patterns

**Graceful Degradation:**

```
Circuit Breaker Decision Flow:
1. Check circuit state
2. If CLOSED → Call primary service
3. If OPEN → Return fallback response
4. If HALF-OPEN → Call primary service with monitoring

Fallback Hierarchy:
1. Try primary service
2. If fails → Try secondary service
3. If fails → Return cached data
4. If no cache → Return default response
```

**User Experience Patterns:**

- **Transparent fallback**: User doesn't notice degraded service
- **Notification fallback**: Inform user of limited functionality
- **Retry invitation**: Suggest user retry operation later
- **Alternative action**: Suggest alternative user actions

### Circuit Breaker Use Cases

## Retry with Exponential Backoff

### Retry Pattern Fundamentals

The Retry pattern handles transient failures by automatically retrying failed operations with increasing delays between attempts, giving failing services time to recover.

### Retry Strategies

#### Linear Backoff

**Characteristics:**

- **Fixed delay**: Same delay between all retry attempts
- **Predictable timing**: Easy to understand and debug
- **Simple implementation**: Straightforward to implement
- **Limited effectiveness**: May not give enough time for recovery

**Use Cases:**

- **Fast-recovering failures**: Network hiccups, temporary congestion
- **Low-latency requirements**: When predictable delays are important
- **Simple scenarios**: Basic retry needs without complex failure patterns

#### Exponential Backoff

**Algorithm:**

```
Retry delay = base_delay * (multiplier ^ attempt_number) + jitter

Example:
Base delay: 100ms, Multiplier: 2
Attempt 1: 100ms
Attempt 2: 200ms
Attempt 3: 400ms
Attempt 4: 800ms
Attempt 5: 1600ms
```

**Benefits:**

- **Gives time to recover**: Longer delays allow services to recover
- **Reduces system load**: Decreasing retry frequency reduces load
- **Handles various failure types**: Effective for different failure durations
- **Industry standard**: Widely adopted pattern

#### Jitter Implementation

**Why Jitter is Important:**

- **Thundering herd prevention**: Avoid all clients retrying simultaneously
- **Load distribution**: Spread retry attempts over time
- **Improved success rates**: Reduce collision probability
- **Better system stability**: Smoother load patterns

**Jitter Types:**

```
Full Jitter:
delay = random(0, base_delay * (2^attempt))

Equal Jitter:
delay = (base_delay * (2^attempt)) / 2 + random(0, (base_delay * (2^attempt)) / 2)

Decorrelated Jitter:
delay = min(cap, random(base_delay, previous_delay * 3))
```

### Retry Configuration

#### Retry Parameters

**Attempt Limits:**

- **Maximum attempts**: Limit total number of retries (e.g., 3-5 attempts)
- **Time-based limits**: Maximum total time for all attempts (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Progressive limits**: Different limits for different failure types
- **Context-dependent**: Different limits for different operations

**Delay Configuration:**

- **Initial delay**: Starting delay for first retry (e.g., 100ms)
- **Maximum delay**: Cap on maximum delay (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Multiplier**: Exponential growth factor (e.g., 2.0)
- **Jitter percentage**: Amount of randomness to add (e.g., 25%)

#### Retry Conditions

**Retryable Errors:**

- **Network timeouts**: Connection timeouts, read timeouts
- **HTTP 5xx errors**: Server errors, service unavailable
- **Rate limiting**: HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- **Database deadlocks**: Temporary database conflicts

**Non-Retryable Errors:**

- **Authentication failures**: HTTP 401, 403 errors
- **Not found errors**: HTTP 404 errors
- **Validation errors**: HTTP 400 Bad Request
- **Business logic errors**: Application-specific errors

### Retry Implementation Patterns

#### Synchronous Retry

**Blocking Retry:**

```
Operation Flow:
1. Attempt operation
2. If success → Return result
3. If retryable failure → Wait for delay
4. Increment attempt counter
5. If under retry limit → Go to step 1
6. If over limit → Return failure
```

**Considerations:**

- **Thread blocking**: Current thread waits during delays
- **Resource usage**: Threads remain allocated during retries
- **User experience**: Users wait for entire retry sequence
- **Timeout coordination**: Coordinate with overall operation timeouts

#### Asynchronous Retry

**Non-Blocking Retry:**

```
Operation Flow:
1. Attempt operation asynchronously
2. If success → Complete future/promise
3. If retryable failure → Schedule retry after delay
4. Use different thread for retry attempt
5. Continue until success or retry limit reached
```

**Benefits:**

- **Resource efficiency**: Don't block threads during delays
- **Better responsiveness**: Other operations can proceed
- **Scalability**: Handle more concurrent operations
- **Timeout handling**: Better timeout management

#### Retry with Circuit Breaker

**Combined Pattern:**

```
Integrated Approach:
1. Check circuit breaker state
2. If OPEN → Return failure immediately (no retry)
3. If CLOSED → Attempt operation with retry logic
4. Track failures for circuit breaker evaluation
5. Update circuit breaker state based on results
```

**Benefits:**

- **Fast failure**: No retry when service is known to be down
- **Resource protection**: Prevent overwhelming failed services
- **Coordinated recovery**: Circuit breaker and retry work together
- **Better observability**: Combined metrics and monitoring
