| **Association**   | A general relationship between objects; can be unidirectional or bidirectional.                                         |                |
| **Aggregation**   | A weak "whole-part" relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole.                                   |                |
| **Composition**   | A strong "whole-part" relationship; the part cannot exist without the whole.                                            |                |
| **Inheritance**   | A relationship where a class (child/subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from another class (parent/superclass). |                |
| **Dependency**    | A relationship where one class uses another class temporarily.                                                          |                |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal object details and exposing only necessary parts.                                                       |                |

**Summary of relationships:**

| Relationship | Nature | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Association** | General link | Teacher *teaches* Student |
| **Aggregation** | Whole-part, weak | Car *has* Engine |
| **Composition** | Whole-part, strong | House *contains* Room |
| **Inheritance** | Is-a relationship | Dog *is a* Animal |
| **Dependency** | Uses temporarily | Class A *uses* Class B |

These terms describe how objects relate and interact in OOP.
