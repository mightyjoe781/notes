# Design Patterns

* Design Pattern serves as typical solution to common problems in software design
* All patterns can categorised by their *intent*
	* Creational Pattern - deals with object creation
	* Structural Pattern - deals organisation of objects/classes
	* Behavioural Patterns - deals with object/classes communications

## Creational Pattern
* Factory ‚≠ê
* Abstract Factory
* Builder ‚≠ê
* Prototype
* Singleton ‚≠ê

### Factory Method ‚≠ê
* also known as virtual constructor
* provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be¬†created
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Step 1: Define an abstract product
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create(self):
        pass

# Step 2: Implement concrete products
class Car(Vehicle):
    def create(self):
        return "Car is created üöó"

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def create(self):
        return "Bike is created üèçÔ∏è"

# Step 3: Define a factory class with a factory method
class VehicleFactory(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_vehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        pass

# Step 4: Implement concrete factories for each vehicle type
class CarFactory(VehicleFactory):
    def get_vehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        return Car()

class BikeFactory(VehicleFactory):
    def get_vehicle(self) -> Vehicle:
        return Bike()

# Step 5: Client code
def client_code(factory: VehicleFactory):
    vehicle = factory.get_vehicle()
    print(vehicle.create())

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    car_factory = CarFactory()
    bike_factory = BikeFactory()

    client_code(car_factory)  # Output: Car is created üöó
    client_code(bike_factory)  # Output: Bike is created üèçÔ∏è
```

* NOTES
	* Decouples Object Creation - Client Classes don't need to know how objects are created
	* Encapsulation - Factory class has the logic to create objects
	* Extensionability - Adding a new Vehicle requires just adding a new subclass, without modifying client code
* Why you don't want user to create objects directly ??
	* Client codes should not be affected with changes in the code. Let's say your process to create object becomes complicated(db calls, using different configurations), then client has no need to know about object creations.
	* Easier Dependency Injection & Testing
	  * If you create Car() directly, testing requires changing the entire class.
	  * With a factory, you can **inject dependencies**, making testing more modular.
### Abstract Factory
### Builder ‚≠ê
* lets you construct complex objects step by step
* The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction¬†code.

Why Use Builder PatternTest

* Better Readability ‚Äì Instead of a constructor with too many parameters, we build the object step by step.
* Flexibility ‚Äì Can construct different variations of an object (e.g., Car, SportsCar, SUV).
* Encapsulation ‚Äì The construction logic is separate from the object representation.

```python
# without builder pattern
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, engine, seats, sunroof):
        self.brand = brand
        self.engine = engine
        self.seats = seats
        self.sunroof = sunroof

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Car({self.brand}, {self.engine}, {self.seats} seats, Sunroof: {self.sunroof})"

# Creating a car object with a long constructor
car = Car("Tesla", "Electric", 5, True)
print(car)
```

Above Implementation has following issues
- Long Constructor
- Optional Parameter
- Hard to Extend

````python
#using builder pattern
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand=None, engine=None, seats=None, sunroof=None):
        self.brand = brand
        self.engine = engine
        self.seats = seats
        self.sunroof = sunroof

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Car({self.brand}, {self.engine}, {self.seats} seats, Sunroof: {self.sunroof})"

class CarBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.car = Car()

    def set_brand(self, brand):
        self.car.brand = brand
        return self  # Enables method chaining

    def set_engine(self, engine):
        self.car.engine = engine
        return self

    def set_seats(self, seats):
        self.car.seats = seats
        return self

    def set_sunroof(self, sunroof):
        self.car.sunroof = sunroof
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.car

# Using the builder pattern
car = CarBuilder().set_brand("Tesla").set_engine("Electric").set_seats(5).set_sunroof(True).build()
print(car)  # ‚úÖ Car(Tesla, Electric, 5 seats, Sunroof: True)
````

- **Readable & Flexible**: No need to remember constructor parameters.
- **Handles Optional Parameters**: Can omit sunroof, engine, etc.
- **Method Chaining**: Allows easy, fluent object creation.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new features without modifying existing code.

### Prototype
### Singleton ‚≠ê
* lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this¬†instance
* Advantages
  * **Prevents multiple instances** of a resource-heavy class.
  * **Centralized access** to a shared instance across the application.
  * **Ensures consistency** when only one instance should exist (e.g., one DB connection)
* Examples Use Cases are one-root logger or one spark context, because spark initialization is costly.
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # Holds the single instance

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls._instance is None:
        # The __new__ method ensures only one instance is created
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Usage
obj1 = Singleton()
obj2 = Singleton()
print(obj1 is obj2)  # ‚úÖ True (Same instance)
```

Other Interesting ways to create Singleton Classes in Python
```python
# using decorator
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Logger:
    def log(self, msg):
        print(f"[LOG]: {msg}")

# Usage
logger1 = Logger()
logger2 = Logger()
print(logger1 is logger2)  # ‚úÖ True (Same instance)

# using metaclasses
# Ensures **any subclass** automatically follows the Singleton pattern.
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Database(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    def connect(self):
        return "Connected to database"

# Usage
db1 = Database()
db2 = Database()
print(db1 is db2)  # ‚úÖ True (Same instance)

```

| **Approach** | **Pros**             | **Cons**         |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| __new__      | Simple, widely used  | Not extendable   |
| Decorator    | Clean, reusable      | Harder debugging |
| Metaclass    | Works for subclasses | Complex          |
