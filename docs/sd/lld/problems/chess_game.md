# Chess Game Design

## Requirements Gathering

**Solution Requirements**

- Do we need to store data in any kind of database or in-memory storage is fine ?
    - In Memory Storage is Fine
- Do we need to implement any kind of network api based interactions or a console driven app ?
    - Console app is fine
- Do we need to write only the class structures or implement working code ?
    - As much working code as possible is require

**Feature Requirements**

- We need to implement a console based 2 player chess game,
- all the basic rules of chess should be kept in mind
- not all the advanced rules are mandatory e.g. Castling,
- Basic Feature like multi-piece support, use should be able to move pieces here and there, attack and capture the pieces.
- Good to Have
    - Every piece can have its dedicated move structure.
- Game should be a in a playable state, i.e. code must be in a running state.
- Good to have: Support bot based player as well.

**Non functional requirements**

- Code should be modular and extensible
- Code should follow all the relevant OOP and Solid principles
- Code should be in a running state
