# Structural Patterns

* Adapter ⭐ 
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator ⭐
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy ⭐

### Adapter ⭐
* allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate
* usecases
  * helps integrate 3rd-party library without modifying their code
  * makes incompatible classes work together
```python
# without adapter
class MP3Player:
    def play_mp3(self, filename):
        print(f"Playing MP3 file: {filename}")

# Client Code
player = MP3Player()
player.play_mp3("song.mp3")  # Works fine ✅
player.play_mp4("video.mp4")  # ❌ AttributeError: 'MP3Player' object has no attribute 'play_mp4'
```
* Using Adapter to modify this class
```python
class MP3Player:
    def play_mp3(self, filename):
        print(f"Playing MP3 file: {filename}")

# Adapter to support other formats
class MediaAdapter:
    def __init__(self, media_type):
        self.media_type = media_type
        self.player = MP3Player()  # Uses existing player

    def play(self, filename):
        if self.media_type == "mp3":
            self.player.play_mp3(filename)
        elif self.media_type == "mp4":
            print(f"Converting {filename} to MP3 format... 🎵")
            self.player.play_mp3(filename.replace(".mp4", ".mp3"))
        else:
            print(f"Error: Unsupported format {self.media_type} ❌")

# Client Code
player = MediaAdapter("mp4")
player.play("video.mp4")  # ✅ Plays after conversion
```
### Bridge
* **decouples an abstraction from its implementation**, allowing them to evolve **independently**
* When to Use
  * **When you want to avoid a rigid class hierarchy** – Prevents class explosion due to multiple variations.
  * **When you need to support multiple implementations** – Example: Different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).
  * **When abstraction and implementation should vary independently** – Example: Devices and their remote controls.
* Key Components
  * **Abstraction** – Defines a high-level interface (e.g., RemoteControl).
  * **Refined Abstraction** – Extends abstraction with additional behavior.
  * **Implementation Interface** – Defines the low-level details (e.g., Device).
  * **Concrete Implementations** – Provide specific implementations.
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Implementation Interface (Device)
class Device(ABC):
    """Defines a common interface for all devices."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def turn_on(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def turn_off(self):
        pass

# Concrete Implementations (TV & Radio)
class TV(Device):
    def turn_on(self):
        print("📺 TV is now ON")

    def turn_off(self):
        print("📺 TV is now OFF")

class Radio(Device):
    def turn_on(self):
        print("📻 Radio is now ON")

    def turn_off(self):
        print("📻 Radio is now OFF")

# Abstraction (Remote Control)
class RemoteControl:
    """Bridge between the abstraction (Remote) and implementation (Device)."""
    
    def __init__(self, device: Device):
        self.device = device

    def toggle_power(self):
        print("🔘 Toggling Power...")
        self.device.turn_on() if isinstance(self.device, TV) else self.device.turn_off()

# Client Code
tv_remote = RemoteControl(TV())
radio_remote = RemoteControl(Radio())

tv_remote.toggle_power()   # 📺 TV is now ON
radio_remote.toggle_power() # 📻 Radio is now OFF
```
### Composite
### Decorator ⭐
* lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
* Usage
  * logging, security, caching & UI improvements
* why use it ?
  * **Extends functionality** without modifying the original class.
  * **Follows Open-Closed Principle** (open for extension, closed for modification).
  * **Allows multiple decorators** to be combined flexibly.
```python
# without Decorator, adding milk to coffee is cumbersome
class Coffee:
    def cost(self):
        return 5

    def description(self):
        return "Basic Coffee"

# Adding features by modifying the class (Not scalable ❌)
class CoffeeWithMilk(Coffee):
    def cost(self):
        return super().cost() + 2

    def description(self):
        return super().description() + " + Milk"

coffee = CoffeeWithMilk()
print(coffee.description())  # Basic Coffee + Milk
print(coffee.cost())  # 7
```
* creating an ingredient decorator
```python
# Base Component
class Coffee:
    def cost(self):
        return 5

    def description(self):
        return "Basic Coffee"

# Decorator Base Class
class CoffeeDecorator:
    def __init__(self, coffee):
        self._coffee = coffee

    def cost(self):
        return self._coffee.cost()

    def description(self):
        return self._coffee.description()

# Concrete Decorators
class MilkDecorator(CoffeeDecorator):
    def cost(self):
        return super().cost() + 2

    def description(self):
        return super().description() + " + Milk"

class SugarDecorator(CoffeeDecorator):
    def cost(self):
        return super().cost() + 1

    def description(self):
        return super().description() + " + Sugar"

# Client Code
coffee = Coffee()
print(coffee.description(), "->", coffee.cost())  # Basic Coffee -> 5

coffee = MilkDecorator(coffee)
print(coffee.description(), "->", coffee.cost())  # Basic Coffee + Milk -> 7

coffee = SugarDecorator(coffee)
print(coffee.description(), "->", coffee.cost())  # Basic Coffee + Milk + Sugar -> 8
```

- Flexible & Scalable
- Combinable - decorators can be combines
- **Follows SOLID principles** – No unnecessary subclasses or modifications.

### Facade
### Flyweight
### Proxy ⭐
* lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
* Advantages
  * Lazy Initialization - Virtual Proxy
  * Access Proxy (Control) - Restriction to access original object
  * Logging/monitoring Proxy - record requests for analytics and debugging
  * Caching Proxy - store results to avoid recomputation
  * Remote Proxy - Interface for calling methods on a remote object
* Virtual Proxy
```python
class RealImage:
    """Heavy object that loads an image from disk."""
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.load_from_disk()

    def load_from_disk(self):
        print(f"Loading image: {self.filename}")

    def display(self):
        print(f"Displaying image: {self.filename}")

class ProxyImage:
    """Proxy that delays the creation of RealImage until display is called."""
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename
        self.real_image = None

    def display(self):
        if self.real_image is None:
            self.real_image = RealImage(self.filename)  # Lazy Initialization
        self.real_image.display()

# Client Code
image = ProxyImage("test_image.jpg")  # Image not loaded yet
image.display()  # Loads image only when needed
image.display()  # Second call does not reload image
```

* logging Proxy
```python
class RealService:
    def operation(self):
        print("Performing an operation in RealService")

class LoggingProxy:
    """Logs requests before calling the actual object."""
    def __init__(self, real_service):
        self.real_service = real_service

    def operation(self):
        print("Logging: Operation is about to be executed")
        self.real_service.operation()
        print("Logging: Operation executed successfully")

# Client Code
service = RealService()
proxy = LoggingProxy(service)
proxy.operation()
```
