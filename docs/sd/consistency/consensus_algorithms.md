# Consensus Algorithms

*Algorithms that enable multiple nodes in a distributed system to agree on a single value or decision, even in the presence of failures, ensuring consistency and coordination across the system.*

#### Overview

Consensus algorithms are fundamental building blocks of distributed systems that solve the problem of achieving agreement among distributed processes. They ensure that all nodes in a system agree on a single value, state, or decision, even when some nodes fail or network partitions occur.

#### The Consensus Problem

In distributed systems, multiple nodes need to agree on:

- **Leader selection**: Which node should coordinate operations
- **State transitions**: What changes to apply to shared state
- **Transaction ordering**: The sequence of operations to execute
- **Configuration changes**: Updates to system membership or settings
- **Failure detection**: Whether a node is alive or dead

#### Core Requirements

All consensus algorithms must satisfy these fundamental properties:

**Agreement**: All correct nodes decide on the same value **Validity**: The decided value must have been proposed by some node **Termination**: All correct nodes eventually reach a decision **Integrity**: Each node decides at most once

## Leader Election

#### What is Leader Election?

Leader election is a consensus problem where distributed nodes must agree on a single node to act as coordinator or leader for subsequent operations. It's often used as a building block for other distributed algorithms.

### Leader Election Challenges

#### Split-Brain Problem

```
Split-Brain Scenario:
Network Partition:
Group A: [Node1*, Node2] - Node1 thinks it's leader
    |
    X  (partition)
    |
Group B: [Node3*, Node4] - Node3 thinks it's leader

Problems:
├── Multiple leaders issuing conflicting commands
├── Data inconsistency across partitions
├── Conflicting decisions about resource allocation
├── System state divergence
└── Recovery complexity when partition heals
```

#### Leader Failure Detection

```
Failure Detection Challenges:
├── Network delays vs actual failures
├── Cascading failure detection
├── False positives causing unnecessary elections
├── Split-brain during leader transitions
└── Performance impact of frequent elections

Detection Mechanisms:
├── Heartbeat messages: Regular ping/pong
├── Lease-based: Time-bounded leadership
├── Gossip protocols: Peer-to-peer failure detection
├── External monitoring: Third-party health checks
└── Consensus-based: Agreement on node status
```

### Leader Election Algorithms

#### Bully Algorithm

```
Bully Algorithm Process:
1. Node detects leader failure
2. Starts election by sending ELECTION message to higher-ID nodes
3. If no response from higher-ID nodes, declares itself leader
4. If response received, waits for new leader announcement
5. New leader sends COORDINATOR message to all nodes

Characteristics:
├── Simple implementation
├── Assumes reliable communication
├── Higher node ID becomes leader
├── O(n²) message complexity in worst case
└── Not suitable for unreliable networks
```

#### Ring-Based Election

```
Ring Election Process:
1. Node initiates election by sending ELECTION message around ring
2. Each node adds its ID to message and forwards
3. When message returns to initiator, highest ID becomes leader
4. ELECTED message sent around ring to announce new leader

Benefits:
├── Guaranteed termination
├── O(n) message complexity
├── Works with unreliable communication
├── Simple to implement
└── Deterministic leader selection

Limitations:
├── Requires logical ring topology
├── Sequential message passing
├── Ring maintenance overhead
└── Failure during election handling
```

#### Consensus-Based Election

```
Modern Approach:
├── Use consensus algorithm (Raft, Paxos) for leader election
├── Majority vote required for leader selection
├── Built-in split-brain prevention
├── Handles network partitions gracefully
└── Integrated with other consensus operations

Benefits:
├── Strong safety guarantees
├── Partition tolerance
├── Proven correctness
├── Industry adoption
└── Tool integration
```

### Leader Election in Practice

#### Apache ZooKeeper

```
ZooKeeper Leader Election:
├── Ephemeral sequential nodes for candidates
├── Lowest sequence number becomes leader
├── Watch mechanism for leadership changes
├── Automatic failover when leader disconnects
└── Built-in split-brain prevention

Implementation Pattern:
1. Each candidate creates ephemeral sequential znode
2. Candidate with lowest sequence number is leader
3. Other candidates watch the predecessor node
4. When predecessor fails, next candidate becomes leader
```

├── Cloud controller manager
├── Custom controller leadership
└── Operator framework
```

## Quorum-based Systems

#### What are Quorum-based Systems?

Quorum-based systems use the concept of a quorum (majority) to make decisions about data consistency and availability. They ensure that operations can proceed as long as a majority of nodes are available and can communicate.

### Quorum Concepts

#### Basic Quorum Mathematics

```
Quorum Rules:
├── N: Total number of replicas
├── R: Number of replicas read from
├── W: Number of replicas written to
├── Quorum: Q = (N/2) + 1

Consistency Guarantees:
├── R + W > N: Strong consistency
├── R + W ≤ N: Eventual consistency
├── W > N/2: Consistency for writes
└── R > N/2: Consistency for reads

Example with N=5:
├── Quorum = 3 nodes
├── Can tolerate 2 node failures
├── Strong consistency: R=3, W=3
└── High availability: R=1, W=3 or R=3, W=1
```

#### Quorum Trade-offs

```
Configuration Trade-offs:
├── R=1, W=N: Fast reads, slow writes, read-optimized
├── R=N, W=1: Slow reads, fast writes, write-optimized
├── R=Q, W=Q: Balanced performance, strong consistency
├── R=1, W=Q: Fast reads, moderate writes, eventual consistency
└── R=Q, W=1: Moderate reads, fast writes, eventual consistency
```

### Quorum Implementation Patterns

#### Multi-Master Replication

```
Multi-Master with Quorum:
1. Write request arrives at any node
2. Coordinate write with W replicas
3. Write succeeds if W nodes acknowledge
4. Read from R replicas for consistency
5. Conflict resolution for concurrent writes

Benefits:
├── No single point of failure
├── Write scalability across regions
├── Configurable consistency levels
├── Partition tolerance
└── Geographic distribution

Challenges:
├── Conflict resolution complexity
├── Write coordination overhead
├── Network partition handling
└── Version vector management
```

#### Read Repair Mechanisms

```
Read Repair Process:
1. Client reads from R replicas
2. Compare versions/timestamps across replicas
3. Detect inconsistencies between replicas
4. Repair inconsistent replicas in background
5. Return most recent value to client

Background Repair:
├── Merkle tree comparison
├── Anti-entropy processes
├── Gossip-based repair
├── Scheduled consistency checks
└── Proactive inconsistency detection
```

### Quorum-based Systems in Practice

#### Apache Cassandra

```
Cassandra Quorum Implementation:
├── Configurable consistency levels per operation
├── Data center aware quorum (LOCAL_QUORUM)
├── Cross-data center consistency (EACH_QUORUM)
├── Tunable CAP theorem trade-offs
└── Automatic repair processes

Consistency Levels:
├── ONE: Single replica response
├── TWO: Two replicas must respond
├── THREE: Three replicas must respond
├── QUORUM: Majority of replicas
├── ALL: All replicas must respond
└── LOCAL_QUORUM: Majority in local DC
```

#### Amazon DynamoDB

```
DynamoDB Quorum Approach:
├── Eventually consistent reads by default
├── Strongly consistent reads available
├── Automatic multi-AZ replication
├── Global secondary indexes
└── Cross-region replication

Write Process:
1. Write to primary AZ
2. Synchronously replicate to 2 other AZs
3. Acknowledge after majority success
4. Background repair for failed replicas
```

### Sloppy Quorums

#### Concept and Implementation

```
Sloppy Quorum Benefits:
├── Higher availability during failures
├── Temporary inconsistency acceptable
├── Hinted handoff for recovery
├── Graceful degradation
└── Improved write availability

Hinted Handoff Process:
1. Primary replica unavailable
2. Write to temporary replica with hint
3. Hint contains intended destination
4. When primary recovers, replay hinted writes
5. Delete hint after successful replay

Trade-offs:
├── Increased availability vs consistency
├── Additional storage for hints
├── Complexity in hint management
├── Potential for data loss scenarios
└── Recovery coordination overhead
```

## Distributed Locking

#### What is Distributed Locking?

Distributed locking provides mutual exclusion across multiple nodes in a distributed system, ensuring that only one process can access a critical resource or execute a critical section at a time.

### Distributed Locking Challenges

#### Lock Implementation Challenges

```
Core Problems:
├── Network failures: Lock holder may be unreachable
├── Process failures: Lock holder crashes
├── Clock skew: Inconsistent timing across nodes
├── Split-brain: Multiple nodes think they hold lock
├── Deadlock detection: Circular lock dependencies
└── Performance: Lock acquisition latency

Safety Requirements:
├── Mutual exclusion: Only one lock holder at a time
├── Deadlock freedom: System doesn't deadlock
├── Fault tolerance: Works despite node failures
├── Eventually unlocks: Locks don't persist forever
└── Fairness: All requesters eventually get lock
```

#### Lease-based Locking

```
Lease Mechanism:
├── Time-bounded lock ownership
├── Automatic expiration prevents stuck locks
├── Renewal protocol for active lock holders
├── Grace period for network delays
└── Deterministic timeout behavior

Lease Protocol:
1. Client requests lock with desired lease time
2. Lock service grants lease with expiration time
3. Client renews lease periodically if still needed
4. Lock automatically expires if not renewed
5. Other clients can acquire lock after expiration

Benefits:
├── Automatic recovery from failures
├── Bounded lock hold time
├── No need for explicit unlock in failure cases
├── Simple implementation
└── Predictable behavior
```

### Distributed Locking Algorithms

#### Redis-based Locking (Redlock)

```
Redlock Algorithm:
1. Get current time in milliseconds
2. Try to acquire lock on all N Redis instances
3. Calculate elapsed time for acquisition attempts
4. Lock considered acquired if:
   - Acquired on majority of instances (N/2+1)
   - Total time < lock validity time
5. Use lock for critical section
6. Release lock on all instances

Safety Properties:
├── Majority agreement prevents split-brain
├── Time bounds prevent infinite lock holding
├── Clock drift tolerance through time checks
├── Automatic expiration in Redis
└── Release attempts on all instances

Limitations:
├── Requires synchronized clocks
├── Not suitable for long-running operations
├── Network partition sensitivity
├── Complex failure scenarios
└── Performance overhead of multiple Redis calls
```

#### Consensus-based Locking

```
ZooKeeper-based Locking:
1. Create ephemeral sequential znode in lock directory
2. Get children of lock directory
3. If created znode has lowest sequence number, acquire lock
4. Otherwise, watch the predecessor znode
5. When predecessor is deleted, retry lock acquisition
6. Delete znode to release lock

Benefits:
├── Strong consistency guarantees
├── Automatic cleanup on client failure
├── FIFO ordering of lock requests
├── No polling required (watch mechanism)
├── Proven correctness properties
└── Handles network partitions gracefully

etcd Implementation:
├── Compare-and-swap operations for atomicity
├── Lease-based expiration
├── Watch API for lock release notifications
├── Transaction support for complex operations
└── Distributed consensus backing
```

### Lock-Free Alternatives

#### Compare-and-Swap (CAS) Operations

```
CAS-based Coordination:
├── Atomic read-modify-write operations
├── No explicit locking required
├── Lock-free data structures
├── High performance and scalability
└── Reduced deadlock risk

CAS Protocol:
1. Read current value
2. Compute new value
3. Atomically compare current value and swap if unchanged
4. Retry if value changed during computation

Applications:
├── Atomic counters
├── Lock-free queues
├── Resource allocation
├── Configuration updates
└── Leader election
```

#### Optimistic Concurrency Control

```
Optimistic Approach:
1. Read data without locking
2. Perform computation/modification
3. Attempt to commit with version check
4. Retry if version conflict detected

Benefits:
├── Higher concurrency than pessimistic locking
├── Better performance for low-conflict scenarios
├── Reduces lock contention
├── Scales better with read-heavy workloads
└── Simpler deadlock handling

Use Cases:
├── Database transactions with MVCC

## Consensus Algorithm Implementations

### Raft Consensus Algorithm

#### Raft Overview

```
Raft Design Principles:
├── Understandability: Easier to understand than Paxos
├── Leader-based: Single leader coordinates operations
├── Log replication: Operations stored in replicated log
├── Term-based: Logical time for leader changes
└── Majority consensus: Decisions require majority agreement

Raft Roles:
├── Leader: Handles client requests, replicates log entries
├── Follower: Passive, responds to leader and candidate requests
├── Candidate: Seeks votes to become leader during election
```

#### Raft Leader Election

```
Election Process:
1. Follower times out waiting for leader heartbeat
2. Increments term and becomes candidate
3. Votes for itself and requests votes from other nodes
4. Becomes leader if receives majority votes
5. Sends heartbeats to establish leadership

Election Properties:
├── At most one leader per term
├── Majority vote required to become leader
├── Higher term numbers take precedence
├── Split vote triggers new election with higher term
└── Randomized timeouts prevent split votes
```

#### Raft Log Replication

```
Log Replication Process:
1. Client sends command to leader
2. Leader appends entry to its log
3. Leader sends AppendEntries to followers
4. Leader commits entry when majority acknowledges
5. Leader notifies followers of commit
6. Followers apply committed entries to state machine

Safety Properties:
├── Log matching: Same index and term implies same entry
├── Leader completeness: Leader has all committed entries
├── State machine safety: All nodes apply same sequence
└── Election safety: At most one leader per term
```

### Paxos Family of Algorithms

#### Basic Paxos

```
Paxos Roles:
├── Proposer: Proposes values for consensus
├── Acceptor: Accepts or rejects proposals
├── Learner: Learns the decided value

Paxos Phases:
├── Phase 1 (Prepare): Proposer asks acceptors to promise
├── Phase 2 (Accept): Proposer asks acceptors to accept value
├── Learning: Learners discover the decided value

Safety Guarantees:
├── At most one value decided per instance
├── Only proposed values can be decided
├── Learners only learn decided values
└── Decision is irreversible once made
```

#### Multi-Paxos Optimization

```
Multi-Paxos Improvements:
├── Stable leader eliminates Phase 1 for subsequent instances
├── Batching reduces message overhead
├── Pipelining improves throughput
├── Log-based approach for sequence of decisions
└── Leader election integrated with consensus

Performance Benefits:
├── Reduced message complexity from 4 to 2 phases
├── Higher throughput for sequence of operations
├── Lower latency for common case
├── More efficient than running Basic Paxos repeatedly
└── Better resource utilization
```

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

#### PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)

```
Byzantine Fault Model:
├── Nodes may behave arbitrarily (malicious or buggy)
├── Can send incorrect, contradictory, or no messages
├── Can collude with other faulty nodes
├── Network may delay, duplicate, or reorder messages
└── Up to f faulty nodes in system of 3f+1 nodes

PBFT Phases:
├── Pre-prepare: Primary proposes operation order
├── Prepare: Backup nodes agree on order
├── Commit: Nodes commit to executing operation
├── Reply: Primary responds to client

Safety Properties:
├── Agreement: All honest nodes execute same operations
├── Validity: Only client requests are executed
├── Liveness: Client requests eventually executed
└── Integrity: Each request executed at most once
```
