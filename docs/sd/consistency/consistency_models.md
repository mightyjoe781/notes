# Consistency Models

*Formal specifications that define the ordering and visibility of operations across distributed systems, determining how and when changes become visible to different parts of the system.*

#### Overview

Consistency models are contracts between distributed systems and applications that specify what values can be returned by read operations. They define the behavior applications can expect when multiple processes access shared data concurrently across different nodes in a distributed system.

#### Why Consistency Models Matter

- **Correctness guarantees**: Define what behaviors are allowed in distributed systems
- **Performance trade-offs**: Stronger consistency typically means higher latency
- **Programming models**: Affect how applications must be designed and reasoned about
- **System design**: Influence architecture decisions and implementation complexity

### Consistency Spectrum

```
Stronger Consistency ←→ Weaker Consistency
        ↓                      ↓
   Higher Latency        Lower Latency
   Lower Availability    Higher Availability
   Simpler Programming   More Complex Programming
   More Coordination     Less Coordination
```

### Common Misconceptions

- **Consistency is binary**: There are many levels between strong and weak
- **Stronger is always better**: Business requirements should drive consistency choice
- **Consistency equals correctness**: Applications can be correct with weaker consistency
- **Database choice determines consistency**: Many systems offer tunable consistency

## Strong Consistency

#### What is Strong Consistency?

Strong consistency ensures that all nodes see the same data at the same time. After a write operation completes, all subsequent reads will return the updated value, regardless of which node serves the read.

### Strong Consistency Characteristics

#### Linearizability (Strongest Model)

```
Linearizability Properties:
├── Real-time ordering: Operations appear in global order
├── Atomic operations: Each operation takes effect instantaneously
├── Immediate visibility: Writes visible to all nodes immediately
├── Single-copy semantics: Appears as single, non-replicated system
└── Global clock: Operations ordered as if on global timeline

Guarantee:
"Once a write is acknowledged, all subsequent reads 
from any node will return the new value"
```

#### Sequential Consistency

```
Sequential Consistency Properties:
├── Program order: Operations from each process in program order
├── Global sequence: All operations appear in single total order
├── No real-time constraints: Operations may be reordered
├── All processes agree: Same order seen by all processes
└── Atomic operations: Operations appear instantaneous

Difference from Linearizability:
"Operations may appear to happen in different order than real-time,
but all processes agree on the order"
```

### Strong Consistency Implementation

#### Consensus-Based Approaches

```
Consensus Algorithm Requirements:
├── Agreement: All nodes decide on same value
├── Validity: Decided value was proposed by some node
├── Termination: All correct nodes eventually decide
├── Integrity: Each node decides at most once
└── Fault tolerance: Works despite node failures

Common Algorithms:
├── Raft: Leader-based consensus with log replication
├── Paxos: Multi-phase consensus protocol
├── PBFT: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
├── Viewstamped Replication: Primary-backup with view changes
└── Zab: ZooKeeper atomic broadcast protocol
```

#### Synchronous Replication

```
Synchronous Replication Process:
1. Client sends write request to coordinator
2. Coordinator forwards write to all replicas
3. All replicas acknowledge write completion
4. Coordinator acknowledges to client
5. Write is now visible to all reads

Trade-offs:
├── Latency: Slowest replica determines response time
├── Availability: Any replica failure affects writes
├── Consistency: Strong consistency guaranteed
├── Partition tolerance: May become unavailable
└── Performance: Limited by coordination overhead
```

### Strong Consistency Systems

#### Traditional RDBMS

```
Relational Database Approach:
├── ACID transactions guarantee consistency
├── Two-phase locking ensures serializability
├── WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) for durability
├── Distributed transactions via 2PC
└── Strong consistency within transaction boundaries

Examples:
├── PostgreSQL with synchronous replication
├── MySQL Cluster (NDB)
├── Oracle RAC
├── SQL Server AlwaysOn
└── Google Spanner (globally distributed)
```

#### Distributed Strong Consistency Systems

```
Specialized Systems:
├── Apache HBase: Strong consistency for row operations
├── etcd: Strongly consistent key-value store

├── TiDB: Distributed SQL with strong consistency
└── CockroachDB: Distributed SQL with serializable isolation

Use Cases:
├── Configuration management
├── Service discovery
├── Leader election
├── Distributed locking
└── Financial transactions
```

### Strong Consistency Trade-offs

#### Performance Implications

```
Performance Costs:
├── Higher latency: Coordination overhead
├── Lower throughput: Synchronization bottlenecks
├── Reduced availability: Sensitive to node failures
├── Geographic limitations: Cross-region coordination expensive
└── Scalability constraints: Coordination doesn't scale linearly

Optimization Strategies:
├── Batching: Group operations to amortize coordination cost
├── Read replicas: Offload reads to reduce coordinator load
├── Partitioning: Reduce coordination scope
├── Caching: Cache frequently accessed data
└── Local operations: Minimize cross-node coordination
```

#### When to Choose Strong Consistency

```
Ideal Use Cases:
├── Financial systems: Account balances, transactions
├── Inventory management: Prevent overselling
├── Distributed counters: Exact counts required
├── Configuration systems: Consistent configuration critical
├── Identity management: User authentication and authorization
├── Regulatory compliance: Audit trails must be consistent
└── Critical business logic: Correctness over performance

Business Requirements:
├── Data integrity is paramount
├── Inconsistent data causes business problems
├── Regulatory or compliance requirements
├── Simple programming model preferred
└── Performance secondary to correctness
```

------

## Eventual Consistency

#### What is Eventual Consistency?

Eventual consistency guarantees that if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. The system will become consistent over time, but not immediately.

### Eventual Consistency Characteristics

#### Basic Properties

```
Eventual Consistency Guarantees:
├── Convergence: All replicas will eventually converge
├── No time bound: No guarantee on when convergence occurs
├── Temporary inconsistency: Different nodes may see different values
├── Update propagation: Changes eventually reach all nodes
└── Conflict resolution: Mechanisms to handle concurrent updates

Key Insight:
"Given enough time and no new updates, 
all nodes will eventually have the same data"
```

#### Conflict Scenarios

```
Common Conflict Situations:
├── Concurrent updates: Multiple clients update same data
├── Network partitions: Updates on different sides of partition
├── Offline updates: Mobile clients updating while disconnected
├── Geographic distribution: Updates in different regions
└── System failures: Updates during node outages

Resolution Requirements:
├── Deterministic resolution: Same conflicts resolve same way
├── Commutative operations: Order independence when possible
├── Associative merging: Consistent regardless of merge order
├── Idempotent operations: Safe to apply multiple times
└── Semantic preservation: Business meaning maintained
```

### Eventual Consistency Implementation

#### Anti-Entropy Mechanisms

```
Convergence Techniques:
├── Gossip protocols: Peer-to-peer information exchange
├── Merkle trees: Efficient difference detection
├── Version vectors: Track causal relationships
├── Read repair: Fix inconsistencies during reads
├── Background repair: Periodic consistency checks
└── Hinted handoff: Store updates for offline nodes

Gossip Protocol Benefits:
├── Scalable: O(log N) messages for N nodes
├── Fault tolerant: Works despite node failures
├── Self-healing: Automatically discovers and fixes inconsistencies
├── Decentralized: No single point of failure
└── Eventually consistent: Guarantees convergence
```

#### Conflict Resolution Strategies

```
Resolution Approaches:
├── Last-write-wins: Use timestamps to resolve conflicts
├── Multi-value: Store all conflicting values
├── Application resolution: Let application decide
├── CRDT operations: Conflict-free data types
├── Custom merge functions: Domain-specific resolution
└── Human intervention: Manual conflict resolution

Vector Clock Example:
Node A: [A:2, B:1, C:0] - A has seen 2 of its own operations, 1 from B
Node B: [A:1, B:3, C:1] - B has seen 1 from A, 3 of its own, 1 from C
Concurrent if neither vector dominates the other
```

------

### Conclusion

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Consistency is a spectrum**: Many levels between strong and weak consistency
2. **Business requirements drive choice**: Technical capabilities must align with business needs
3. **Trade-offs are fundamental**: Consistency, availability, and performance are interconnected
4. **Session consistency is often ideal**: Good balance for interactive applications
5. **Hybrid approaches work**: Different data types can use different consistency models

#### Implementation Guidelines

**For Strong Consistency**:

- Use for critical business data where correctness is paramount
- Implement proper consensus algorithms or synchronous replication
- Plan for reduced availability during partitions
- Monitor performance impact and optimize coordination overhead
- Test failure scenarios and recovery procedures

**For Eventual Consistency**:

- Design conflict resolution strategies from the beginning
- Implement monitoring for convergence and conflicts
- Educate users about temporary inconsistencies
- Use CRDTs or other conflict-free approaches where possible
- Plan for operational complexity of debugging

**For Session Consistency**:

- Implement client-side version tracking
- Design session affinity or read-after-write routing
- Balance session state management overhead
- Monitor session consistency violations
- Provide clear guarantees to application developers

#### Common Pitfalls

- **Choosing consistency too early**: Start with requirements, not technology
- **Underestimating complexity**: Weaker consistency often means more complex applications
- **Ignoring user experience**: Consistency affects how users perceive the system
- **Not testing edge cases**: Consistency violations often occur in failure scenarios
- **Over-engineering**: Don't use stronger consistency than actually needed

Remember: Consistency models are about finding the right balance between correctness, performance, and availability for your specific use case. The "best" consistency model is the one that meets your business requirements with acceptable complexity and cost.
