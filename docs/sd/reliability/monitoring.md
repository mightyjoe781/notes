# Monitoring & Observability

*The ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its outputs - logs, metrics, and traces.*

### Overview

Observability is about building systems that can explain themselves. While monitoring tells you **what** is happening, observability helps you understand **why** it's happening.

#### The Three Pillars of Observability

1. **Logs**: Discrete events with timestamps and context
2. **Metrics**: Numerical measurements over time
3. **Traces**: Request journey across distributed systems

#### Key Principles

- **Instrument Everything**: You can't debug what you can't see
- **High Cardinality**: Rich dimensional data for better insights
- **Low Latency**: Real-time insights for faster response
- **Cost Effective**: Balance detail with storage/processing costs
- **Actionable**: Data should lead to specific actions

#### Monitoring vs Observability

| Monitoring            | Observability           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Known unknowns**    | **Unknown unknowns**    |
| Predefined dashboards | Exploratory analysis    |
| "Is it working?"      | "Why isn't it working?" |
| Reactive              | Proactive               |
| System health         | System understanding    |

## Logging Strategies

### What is Logging?

Logs are immutable, timestamped records of events that happened in your system. They provide detailed context about system behavior and are essential for debugging and auditing.

#### Log Levels and When to Use Them

```
ERROR   → System errors, exceptions, failed operations
WARN    → Potential problems, degraded performance  
INFO    → Important business events, state changes
DEBUG   → Detailed execution flow, variable values
TRACE   → Very detailed execution path (rarely used in production)
```

**Production Log Level Guidelines**:

- **Default**: INFO level for most services
- **High Traffic Services**: WARN level to reduce volume
- **Critical Services**: ERROR level only during incidents
- **New Deployments**: DEBUG level temporarily for validation

### Structured vs Unstructured Logging

#### Unstructured Logging (Avoid)

```
"User john123 failed to login from IP 192.168.1.100 at 2024-01-15 14:30:25"
```

**Problems**: Hard to parse, search, and analyze

#### Structured Logging (Preferred)

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:25Z",
  "level": "WARN",
  "event": "login_failed", 
  "user_id": "john123",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "reason": "invalid_password",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "version": "v1.2.3"
}
```

**Benefits**:

- Easy to search and filter
- Consistent format across services
- Better integration with log analysis tools
- Enables automated alerting

### What to Log

#### Always Log

- **Authentication events**: Login/logout, failed attempts
- **Authorization failures**: Access denied events
- **Business transactions**: Orders, payments, critical workflows
- **Errors and exceptions**: Stack traces with context
- **External API calls**: Requests/responses, latencies, errors
- **Performance milestones**: Slow queries, timeouts

#### Sometimes Log (Based on Service)

- **User actions**: Clicks, page views (with privacy considerations)
- **Data changes**: CRUD operations (be mindful of PII)
- **System events**: Deployments, configuration changes
- **Resource usage**: Memory spikes, CPU usage

#### Never Log

- **Passwords or secrets**: Even hashed passwords
- **PII without consent**: Personal data, credit cards
- **High-frequency events**: Every cache hit, every health check
- **Redundant information**: Data already captured in metrics

### Log Aggregation Strategies

#### Centralized Logging Architecture

```
Application Servers
├── Service A → Log Agent → Log Shipper
├── Service B → Log Agent → Log Shipper  
├── Service C → Log Agent → Log Shipper
└── Load Balancer → Log Agent → Log Shipper
                               ↓
                    Centralized Log Storage
                    (Elasticsearch, CloudWatch)
                               ↓
                    Log Analysis & Alerting
                    (Kibana, Grafana, Custom Dashboards)
```

#### Log Shipping Methods

**Pull-based (Log Files)**:

- Log to local files, ship via agents (Filebeat, Fluentd)
- **Pros**: Reliable, handles backpressure
- **Cons**: Disk space usage, shipping delays

**Push-based (Direct Shipping)**:

- Send logs directly to central system
- **Pros**: Real-time, no local storage
- **Cons**: Can block application, requires error handling

**Async Queue-based**:

- Application → Local Queue → Background Shipper
- **Pros**: Non-blocking, reliable
- **Cons**: More complex, potential message loss

### Log Retention and Storage

#### Retention Strategy by Log Type

```
Log Type              | Retention Period | Storage Type
---------------------|------------------|-------------
Error Logs           | 1 year          | Hot storage
Application Logs     | 3 months        | Warm storage  
Access Logs          | 1 month         | Warm storage
Debug Logs           | 1 week          | Hot storage
Audit Logs           | 7 years         | Cold storage
```

#### Cost Optimization

- **Hot Storage**: SSD, immediately searchable (expensive)
- **Warm Storage**: HDD, searchable with delay (medium cost)
- **Cold Storage**: Archive, restore time required (cheap)
- **Log Sampling**: Sample high-volume logs (1 in 100 requests)
- **Log Compression**: Gzip, LZ4 for significant space savings

### Logging Best Practices

#### Correlation IDs

```json
{
  "trace_id": "abc123",      // Unique per request across all services
  "span_id": "def456",       // Unique per service operation
  "user_id": "user789",      // Business context
  "session_id": "sess101"    // Session context
}
```

#### Contextual Logging Pattern

```python
# Bad: Hard to correlate logs
logger.info("Processing payment")
logger.info("Validating card")
logger.error("Payment failed")

# Good: Rich context in every log
logger.info("Processing payment", {
    "user_id": "user123", 
    "order_id": "order456",
    "amount": 99.99,
    "payment_method": "credit_card"
})
```

#### Log Sampling for High Volume

```python
# Sample based on business importance
def should_log(event_type, user_tier):
    if event_type == "error":
        return True  # Always log errors
    elif user_tier == "premium":
        return True  # Always log premium user events
    elif event_type == "page_view":
        return random.random() < 0.01  # 1% sampling for page views
    else:
        return random.random() < 0.1   # 10% sampling for other events
```

## Metrics & Alerting

### What are Metrics?

Metrics are numerical measurements of your system over time. They provide quantitative insights into system behavior and performance trends.

### Types of Metrics

#### Business Metrics

- **Revenue**: Orders per minute, revenue per hour
- **User Engagement**: Active users, session duration
- **Conversion**: Signup rate, purchase completion rate
- **Growth**: New user registrations, retention rate

#### Application Metrics

- **Throughput**: Requests per second, transactions per minute
- **Latency**: Response times, processing duration
- **Error Rates**: HTTP 4xx/5xx errors, exception rates
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage, SLA compliance

#### Infrastructure Metrics

- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Capacity**: Available storage, connection pool usage
- **Performance**: Disk I/O, network throughput

#### Custom Business Logic Metrics

- **Queue Depth**: Background job queue size
- **Cache Performance**: Hit/miss ratios
- **Feature Usage**: Feature adoption rates
- **Data Quality**: Record validation failures

### Metric Collection Patterns

#### Push vs Pull Models

**Push Model** (StatsD, CloudWatch):

```python
# Application sends metrics to collector
metrics.increment("user.login.success")
metrics.timing("db.query.duration", 150)  # milliseconds
metrics.gauge("active_connections", 42)
```

**Pull Model** (Prometheus):

```python
# Collector scrapes metrics from application endpoints
# /metrics endpoint returns:
# http_requests_total{method="GET",status="200"} 1234
# http_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.95"} 0.123
```

#### Time Series Data Structure

```
Metric Name: http_requests_total
Labels/Tags: {service="api", method="GET", status="200", region="us-east"}
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:30:00Z
Value: 1234
```

### Key Metrics to Track

#### The Golden Signals (Google SRE)

1. **Latency**: Time to process requests
2. **Traffic**: Demand on your system (RPS)
3. **Errors**: Rate of failed requests
4. **Saturation**: How "full" your system is

#### The RED Method (for Services)

- **Rate**: Requests per second
- **Errors**: Number/percentage of failed requests
- **Duration**: Time taken to process requests

#### The USE Method (for Resources)

- **Utilization**: Percentage of time resource is busy
- **Saturation**: Amount of work resource cannot process (queue depth)
- **Errors**: Count of error events

### Alerting Strategies

#### Alert Pyramid

```
           Alerts (Pages)
          ↗               ↖
    Dashboards         Runbooks
   ↗                           ↖
Logs                           Metrics
```

#### Alert Types

**Threshold-based Alerts**:

```
CPU Usage > 80% for 5 minutes → WARNING
CPU Usage > 95% for 2 minutes → CRITICAL
Error Rate > 5% for 10 minutes → WARNING  
Error Rate > 10% for 5 minutes → CRITICAL
```

**Anomaly-based Alerts**:

```
Request volume deviates > 3 standard deviations from weekly pattern
Response time increases > 50% compared to previous hour
Error rate spikes beyond historical variance
```

**Composite Alerts**:

```
High Error Rate AND High Latency AND Low Throughput = Service Degradation
```

#### Alert Severity Levels

```
CRITICAL (Page immediately):
├── Service completely down
├── Data corruption/loss
├── Security breach
└── SLA violation imminent

WARNING (Investigate within 1 hour):  
├── Performance degradation
├── High error rates
├── Resource approaching limits
└── Backup failures

INFO (Review during business hours):
├── Capacity planning alerts
├── Deployment notifications  
├── Weekly/monthly reports
└── Trend notifications
```

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

#### Alert Tuning Strategies

- **Appropriate Thresholds**: Avoid alerts for normal variations
- **Time-based Rules**: Different thresholds for business/off hours
- **Alert Grouping**: Combine related alerts to reduce noise
- **Auto-resolution**: Clear alerts when conditions normalize

#### Alert Escalation

```
Alert Lifecycle:
1. Alert fires → Notification sent
2. 15 minutes no ack → Escalate to team lead
3. 30 minutes no ack → Escalate to manager  
4. 60 minutes no ack → Escalate to director
5. Alert resolves → Send resolution notification
```

## Distributed Tracing

### What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through multiple services, providing visibility into complex distributed system interactions.

### Tracing Concepts

#### Core Components

- **Trace**: Complete journey of a request across all services
- **Span**: Individual operation within a trace (API call, database query)
- **Tags**: Key-value metadata attached to spans
- **Baggage**: Data carried through the entire trace

#### Trace Visualization

```
Trace: User Login Request (trace_id: abc123)
│
├─ Span: API Gateway (100ms)
│  ├─ Span: Auth Service (50ms)
│  │  ├─ Span: Database Query - User Lookup (20ms)
│  │  └─ Span: Redis Cache - Session Store (5ms)
│  └─ Span: User Service (30ms)
│     └─ Span: Database Query - Profile Load (25ms)
│
Total Duration: 100ms
Critical Path: API Gateway → Auth Service → Database Query
```

### Implementing Distributed Tracing

#### Trace Context Propagation

```python
# Incoming request with trace context
def handle_request(request):
    trace_context = extract_trace_context(request.headers)
    
    with start_span("process_request", trace_context) as span:
        span.set_tag("user_id", request.user_id)
        span.set_tag("endpoint", request.path)
        
        # Call downstream service with propagated context
        response = call_user_service(request, trace_context)
        
        span.set_tag("response_status", response.status)
        return response

def call_user_service(request, trace_context):
    headers = inject_trace_context(trace_context)
    return http_client.post("/user", data=request.data, headers=headers)
```

#### Sampling Strategies

```
Sampling Types:
├── Head-based Sampling (at ingestion)
│   ├── Probability: Sample 1% of all traces
│   ├── Rate Limiting: Max 1000 traces/second
│   └── Adaptive: Adjust based on traffic volume
│
└── Tail-based Sampling (after completion)
    ├── Error Traces: Always sample traces with errors
    ├── Slow Traces: Sample traces > 95th percentile
    └── Important Users: Sample VIP user traces
```

### What to Trace

#### Service Boundaries

- **HTTP requests**: Between microservices
- **Database operations**: Queries, transactions
- **External API calls**: Third-party services
- **Message queue operations**: Publish/consume
- **Cache operations**: Get/set operations

#### Internal Operations

- **Business logic**: Key decision points
- **Expensive operations**: Complex calculations
- **Async operations**: Background processing
- **Resource operations**: File I/O, network calls

### 3.4 Trace Analysis Patterns

#### Common Issues Tracing Helps Identify

```
Performance Issues:
├── Slow database queries (span duration analysis)
├── N+1 query problems (span frequency patterns)
├── Network latency spikes (service-to-service spans)
└── Resource contention (parallel span analysis)

Reliability Issues:  
├── Cascade failures (error propagation paths)
├── Retry storms (repeated failed spans)
├── Timeout issues (span duration vs timeout)
└── Circuit breaker patterns (span success/failure rates)
```

#### Trace-based Alerting

```python
# Alert on suspicious trace patterns
def analyze_trace(trace):
    alerts = []
    
    if trace.total_duration > SLA_THRESHOLD:
        alerts.append("SLA_VIOLATION")
    
    error_spans = [s for s in trace.spans if s.has_error()]
    if len(error_spans) > 0:
        alerts.append("ERROR_IN_TRACE")
    
    db_spans = [s for s in trace.spans if s.operation_type == "db"]
    if len(db_spans) > 50:  # N+1 query detection
        alerts.append("POTENTIAL_N_PLUS_ONE")
    
    return alerts
```

### Tracing Best Practices

#### Span Naming and Tagging

```python
# Good span structure
span.operation_name = "db.query.users.select"
span.tags = {
    "db.type": "postgresql",
    "db.statement": "SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = true",
    "db.rows_affected": 150,
    "user.tier": "premium"
}

# Avoid high cardinality tags
# Bad: span.set_tag("user_id", user_id)  # Too many unique values
# Good: span.set_tag("user_tier", user_tier)  # Limited set of values
```

#### Error Handling in Traces

```python
def traced_operation():
    with tracer.start_span("business_operation") as span:
        try:
            result = complex_business_logic()
            span.set_tag("success", True)
            return result
        except BusinessLogicError as e:
            span.set_tag("error", True)
            span.set_tag("error.type", "business_logic")
            span.set_tag("error.message", str(e))
            raise
        except Exception as e:
            span.set_tag("error", True)
            span.set_tag("error.type", "unexpected")
            span.log_kv({"event": "error", "message": str(e)})
            raise
```

## Health Checks

### What are Health Checks?

Health checks are automated tests that verify if a system component is functioning correctly. They're essential for load balancing, auto-scaling, and incident detection.

### Types of Health Checks

#### Shallow Health Checks (< 100ms)

**Purpose**: Quick verification that service is responsive

```python
def shallow_health_check():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "timestamp": current_time(),
        "service": "user-api",
        "version": "v1.2.3",
        "uptime": get_uptime_seconds()
    }
```

**What to Check**:

- Process is running and responsive
- Basic connectivity (port responding)
- Memory/CPU within acceptable ranges
- No critical exceptions in recent logs

#### Deep Health Checks (< 5 seconds)

**Purpose**: Verify that service can perform its core functions

```python
def deep_health_check():
    checks = {
        "database": check_database_connectivity(),
        "cache": check_redis_connectivity(), 
        "external_api": check_payment_service(),
        "disk_space": check_available_disk_space(),
        "feature_flags": check_feature_flag_service()
    }
    
    overall_status = "healthy" if all(checks.values()) else "unhealthy"
    
    return {
        "status": overall_status,
        "checks": checks,
        "timestamp": current_time()
    }
```

#### Business Logic Health Checks (< 30 seconds)

**Purpose**: Ensure critical business workflows are functioning

```python
def business_health_check():
    try:
        # Test critical business workflow
        test_user = create_test_user()
        test_order = create_test_order(test_user)
        process_test_payment(test_order)
        cleanup_test_data(test_user, test_order)
        
        return {"status": "healthy", "workflow": "end_to_end_test_passed"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
```

### Health Check Endpoints

#### Endpoint Design Patterns

```
GET /health              → Shallow health check (for load balancers)
GET /health/ready        → Deep health check (for deployment readiness)  
GET /health/live         → Liveness check (for container orchestration)
GET /health/detailed     → Comprehensive health with component details
```

#### Response Format Standards

```json
{
  "status": "healthy|degraded|unhealthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:25Z",
  "service": {
    "name": "user-service",
    "version": "v1.2.3",
    "uptime": 86400
  },
  "checks": {
    "database": {
      "status": "healthy",
      "response_time": 15,
      "last_check": "2024-01-15T14:30:25Z"
    },
    "cache": {
      "status": "degraded", 
      "response_time": 150,
      "error": "High latency detected"
    }
  },
  "dependencies": [
    {"name": "payment-service", "status": "healthy"},
    {"name": "notification-service", "status": "unknown"}
  ]
}
```

### Health Check Implementation Strategies

#### Graceful Degradation in Health Checks

```python
def adaptive_health_check():
    critical_systems = check_critical_dependencies()
    non_critical_systems = check_optional_dependencies()
    
    if all(critical_systems.values()):
        if all(non_critical_systems.values()):
            return "healthy"
        else:
            return "degraded"  # Can operate with reduced functionality
    else:
        return "unhealthy"    # Cannot operate safely
```

#### Health Check Caching

```python
class CachedHealthCheck:
    def __init__(self, cache_ttl=30):
        self.cache_ttl = cache_ttl
        self.last_check_time = 0
        self.cached_result = None
    
    def get_health(self):
        current_time = time.time()
        
        if (current_time - self.last_check_time) > self.cache_ttl:
            self.cached_result = self.perform_health_check()
            self.last_check_time = current_time
            
        return self.cached_result
```

### Health Check Best Practices

#### Load Balancer Integration

```yaml
# Example: AWS ALB Health Check Configuration
health_check:
  path: "/health"
  port: 8080
  protocol: "HTTP"
  interval: 30                    # Check every 30 seconds
  timeout: 5                      # 5 second timeout
  healthy_threshold: 2            # 2 consecutive successes = healthy
  unhealthy_threshold: 3          # 3 consecutive failures = unhealthy
  matcher: "200"                  # HTTP 200 response expected
```

#### Kubernetes Health Checks

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    livenessProbe:                # Restart container if failing
      httpGet:
        path: /health/live
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
      
    readinessProbe:               # Remove from service if failing  
      httpGet:
        path: /health/ready
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

#### Health Check Monitoring

```python
def monitored_health_check():
    start_time = time.time()
    
    try:
        result = perform_health_check()
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        
        # Record metrics
        metrics.timing("health_check.duration", duration)
        metrics.increment(f"health_check.status.{result['status']}")
        
        # Log health check results
        logger.info("Health check completed", {
            "status": result["status"],
            "duration": duration,
            "checks": result.get("checks", {})
        })
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        metrics.timing("health_check.duration", duration)
        metrics.increment("health_check.status.error")
        
        logger.error("Health check failed", {
            "error": str(e),
            "duration": duration
        })
        
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
```

## Monitoring Architecture Patterns

### Centralized vs Distributed Monitoring

#### Centralized Monitoring

```
All Services → Metrics Collector → Central Storage → Dashboards
             → Log Aggregator   → Central Storage → Search UI
             → Trace Collector  → Central Storage → Trace UI
```

**Benefits**:

- Single pane of glass
- Easier correlation across services
- Centralized alerting and configuration

**Drawbacks**:

- Single point of failure
- Network overhead
- Scaling challenges

#### Distributed Monitoring

```
Service A → Local Collector → Regional Aggregator → Global View
Service B → Local Collector → Regional Aggregator → Global View
Service C → Local Collector → Regional Aggregator → Global View
```

**Benefits**:

- Better performance (local collection)
- Fault isolation
- Regional compliance

**Drawbacks**:

- Complex correlation
- Inconsistent views
- Management overhead

### Monitoring Data Pipeline

#### Real-time Pipeline

```
Application → Buffer → Stream Processor → Real-time Dashboards
                    → Alerting Engine  → Notifications
                    → Anomaly Detector → Automated Actions
```

#### Batch Processing Pipeline

```
Application → Storage → ETL Jobs → Data Warehouse → Analytics
                     → ML Models → Predictions
                     → Reports   → Business Insights
```

### Tool Selection Guide

## Implementation Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy Framework

#### Start with SLIs/SLOs

```
Service Level Indicators (SLIs):
├── Availability: 99.9% uptime
├── Latency: 95% of requests < 200ms
├── Error Rate: < 0.1% error rate
└── Throughput: Handle 1000 RPS

Service Level Objectives (SLOs):
├── Based on business requirements
├── Measurable and realistic
├── Drive monitoring priorities
└── Inform alerting thresholds
```

#### Monitoring Maturity Levels

```
Level 1 - Basic:
├── Infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory)
├── Simple uptime checks
├── Basic log collection
└── Manual incident response

Level 2 - Intermediate:
├── Application metrics
├── Structured logging  
├── Alert automation
└── Runbook documentation

Level 3 - Advanced:
├── Distributed tracing
├── Anomaly detection
├── Predictive alerting
└── Auto-remediation

Level 4 - Expert:
├── Business metric correlation
├── ML-driven insights
├── Chaos engineering integration
└── Self-healing systems
```

### Cost Optimization

#### Data Retention Strategy

```
Data Type          | Hot Storage | Warm Storage | Cold Storage
-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------
Real-time Metrics  | 7 days      | 90 days      | 2 years
Application Logs   | 30 days     | 90 days      | 1 year  
Trace Data         | 7 days      | 30 days      | 90 days
Error Logs         | 90 days     | 1 year       | 3 years
Audit Logs         | 1 year      | 3 years      | 7 years
```

#### Sampling and Aggregation

```python
# Intelligent sampling based on value
def should_collect_metric(metric_name, value, context):
    if metric_name.endswith(".error_count"):
        return True  # Always collect error metrics
    
    if context.get("user_tier") == "premium":
        return True  # Always monitor premium users
        
    if is_business_hours():
        return random.random() < 0.1  # 10% sampling during business hours
    else:
        return random.random() < 0.01  # 1% sampling off-hours
```

### Security and Compliance

#### Sensitive Data Handling

- **PII Scrubbing**: Remove personal data from logs automatically
- **Secret Detection**: Scan for API keys, passwords in logs
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to monitoring data
- **Audit Logging**: Track who accessed what monitoring data

#### Compliance Considerations

```
GDPR Compliance:
├── Data retention limits
├── Right to deletion
├── Data processing transparency
└── Cross-border data transfer restrictions

SOX Compliance:
├── Audit trail completeness
├── Change management tracking
├── Access control documentation
└── Data integrity verification
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Tool Proliferation**: Too many monitoring tools without integration
- **Alert Fatigue**: Poorly tuned alerts that cry wolf
- **Data Silos**: Logs, metrics, and traces that don't correlate
- **High Cardinality**: Metrics that explode storage costs
- **Missing Context**: Monitoring data without business relevance
- **Reactive Approach**: Only adding monitoring after incidents

Remember: Good observability enables faster debugging, better decision-making, and improved system reliability. It's an investment that pays dividends in reduced downtime and improved user experience.
