| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Team Size**     | < 10 engineers               | > 20 engineers                 |
| **Expertise**     | Limited ops experience       | Strong ops team                |
| **Compliance**    | Standard requirements        | Custom compliance needs        |
| **Customization** | Standard features sufficient | Extensive customization needed |
| **Scale**         | Variable or moderate         | Massive, predictable scale     |
| **Budget**        | Prefer OpEx                  | Have CapEx budget              |
| **Timeline**      | Fast deployment needed       | Long-term project              |
| **Control**       | Convenience over control     | Need full control              |

#### Cost Comparison Examples

```
Database Service Cost Analysis (500GB, Medium Load):

Self-Managed PostgreSQL:
├── EC2 instances (2x m5.large): $140/month
├── EBS storage (500GB): $50/month
├── Backup storage: $15/month
├── Operations time (20h/month): $2000/month
└── Total: ~$2,205/month

Managed RDS PostgreSQL:
├── RDS instance (db.m5.large): $180/month
├── Storage (500GB): $115/month
├── Backup storage: $15/month
├── Operations time (5h/month): $500/month
└── Total: ~$810/month

Break-even: Managed becomes expensive at very large scales
```

#### Multi-Cloud Strategy Considerations

```
Multi-Cloud Approach Benefits:
├── Avoid vendor lock-in
├── Geographic coverage optimization
├── Best-of-breed service selection
├── Compliance with data residency
└── Risk mitigation

Multi-Cloud Challenges:
├── Increased complexity
├── Multiple billing and management
├── Integration difficulties
├── Skill set requirements
├── Data transfer costs

Hybrid Cloud Patterns:
├── Cloud bursting: Overflow to cloud
├── Data replication: Multi-region backup
├── Service distribution: Different services per cloud
├── Geographic distribution: Services by region
└── Disaster recovery: Cross-cloud backup
```

#### Service Selection Guidelines

```
Choosing Cloud Services:
├── Start with managed services
├── Evaluate vendor lock-in risks
├── Consider total cost of ownership
├── Assess team capabilities
├── Plan for scale and growth
├── Understand compliance requirements
└── Have exit strategy

Service Migration Path:
1. Lift-and-shift: VMs to cloud VMs
2. Re-platform: Use managed databases
3. Re-architect: Microservices and serverless
4. Rebuild: Cloud-native applications
5. Replace: SaaS solutions
```
