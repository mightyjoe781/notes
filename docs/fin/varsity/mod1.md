## Introduction to Stock Market

### Need to Invest

Everyone worries about what future might hold for them. People invest to secure their future. Investments are useful in old age or a critical time of need.

Value of money depreciates year on year that is know as Inflation. In simpler terms same packet of milk that you have bought for 14 INR two months ago is now 16 INR. It has become more expensive or commodity remained same but the value of money depreciated.

Every investments has different returns which is proportional to risk associated with the investment. We can broadly divide investments in 4 categories.

1. Equity : Highest return and high risks as well. Ex : US Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), etc.
2. Real Estate : Quite good return and little risk, but a huge problem of liquidity and outlay cash required for Investments. Ex : Apartments, Flats and Agricultural Lands.
3. Commodity : little return and negligible risk, very good liquidity. Ex : gold, silver bonds.
4. Fixed Income Instruments : negligible return, effectively losing money. Ex : FDs, Bonds by Govt. or related agencies like HUDCO, NHAI. Corporate bonds.

Amount of risk an individual can take directly depends on their age, At younger age (<30), A person should do high risk investments in his portfolio and should slowly diversify and move his portfolio towards with more safe investments during his retirement.
