# Subarrays & Subsequences

* core concepts in problems related to array and string problems
* Its important to understand the difference between them

## Subarrays

* A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.
* Formed by selecting a continuous segment `(A[l..r])` where `(0 <= l <= r < n)`

* number of subarrays in an array of `n` size : `n(n+1)/2`
* order of element is preserved and contiguous
* sliding window & prefix sums are important tools to solve subarray related problems

### Common Problems

* Maximum Sum Subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm)
* Counting Subarrays with Certain sum or property
* Longest Subarray with Constraint

### Examples

```c++
int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
	int n = nums.size(), i ,res = INT_MIN;
	int prev = 0, curr;
    for(i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        curr = max(prev + nums[i-1], nums[i-1]);
        res = max(res,curr);
        prev = curr;
    } 
  return res; 
}
```



## Subsequences

* sequence derived from the array by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of remaining elements
* not necessarily contiguous

* number of subsequences in an array of size `n` is `2^n`
* usually these problems are optimally solvable by using DP

### Common Problems

* Longest Increasing Subsquence (LIS)
* Counting subsequences with certain properties
* Subsequences sum problems

```c++
// Example with DP
int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    vector<int> dp(n, 1);
    int maxLength = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxLength = max(maxLength, dp[i]);
    }
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Problems

Subarrays

Pre-requisite : Prefix and Sliding Window

* Longest Subarray with Given Sum
* Count of Subarrays with Given Sum

Subsequences

Pre-requsite : Recursion, DP
