# Dynamic Programming

Key skill to master DP is ability to determine the problem *states* and to determine the relationship or *transitions* between current problems and their sub-problems.

Identify problems related to Dynamic Programming by determining whether the problem can be solved by counting solutions rather than enumeration or involve Optimization. Often, pruning is necessary to obtain the answer within time limits.

If the problem cannot be solved using another technique, dynamic programming must be applied.

### Types of DP Problems

| **Type**               | **Dimension** | **Core Idea / State**                 | **Common Examples**                          | **Techniques**                        |
