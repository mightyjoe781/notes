Computational Geometry

Topics:
	•	Orientation (clockwise / counterclockwise / collinear)
	•	Area of triangle, polygon
	•	Point-in-polygon test (ray-casting or winding number)
	•	Line segment intersection
	•	Distance between points, point to line, etc.
	•	Angle between vectors
	•	Cross and dot product
	•	Convex vs. concave polygons
	•	Geometric transformations (rotation, scaling, reflection)
	•	Handling floating-point precision
