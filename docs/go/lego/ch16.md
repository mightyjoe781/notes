# Here Be Dragons: Reflect, Unsafe, and Go
* when the type of the data can’t be determined at compile time, you can use the reflection support in the `reflect` package to interact with and even construct data. 
* When you need to take advantage of the memory layout of data types in Go, you can use the `unsafe` package. 
* if there is functionality that can be provided only by libraries written in C, you can call into C code with `cgo`.
## Reflections Lets You work with Types at Runtime
* **Definition**: Reflection allows working with types and variables dynamically at runtime.
* It provides the ability to examine, modify, and create variables, functions, and structs at runtime.
* Reflection are often encountered at boundary of your program and external world.
* **Use Cases**:
   	* Database operations (database/sql)
   	* Templating (text/template, html/template)
   	* Formatting (fmt package)
   	* Error handling (errors.Is, errors.As)
   	* Sorting (sort.Slice, etc.)
   	* Data serialization (encoding/json, encoding/xml)
* **Performance Impact**
   	* Slower than normal type-based operations.
   	* More complex and fragile; can lead to panics if misused.
   	* Should be used only when necessary.
* **Risks**
   	* Can cause crashes if misused.
   	* Code using unsafe may break in future Go versions.
### Types, Kinds, and Values
* reflection is built around three core concepts : types, kinds, values
#### Types and kinds
* **Type**: Defines a variable’s properties, what it can hold, and how it behaves.
   	* Obtained using reflect.TypeOf(v).
   	* Name() gives the type’s name (e.g., "int", "Foo")
* **Kind**: Represents the underlying nature of the type (e.g., reflect.Int, reflect.Struct, reflect.Pointer).
   	* Obtained using Kind().
   	* Important for determining valid reflection operations to avoid panics.
* Inspecting Types
   	* `Elem()`: Used to get the element type of a pointer, slice, map, or array.
   	* `NumField()`: Returns the number of fields in a struct.
   	* `Field(i)`: Retrieves details of a struct field, including name, type, and tags.
* working with values
   	* reflect.ValueOf(v): Creates a reflect.Value instance representing a variable’s value.
   	* Interface(): Retrieves the value as any, requiring type assertion to use it.
   	* Type-specific methods: Int(), String(), Bool(), etc., retrieve primitive values
   	* CanSet(): Checks if a value can be modified.
* modifying values
   	* Requires passing a pointer to reflect.ValueOf(&v)
   	* Elem(): Gets the actual value from a pointer.
   	* SetInt(), SetString(), Set(): Modify values if CanSet() is true.
* Creating New Values
   	* reflect.New(t): Creates a new instance of a type (reflect.Value)
   	* MakeChan(), MakeMap(), MakeSlice(): Create respective Go data structures
   	* Append(): Adds elements to a slice
* checking Nil interfaces
   	* IsValid(): Checks if a reflect.Value holds anything (false for nil).
   	* IsNil(): Checks if the value is nil (only for pointer, slice, map, func, or interface kinds).
### Use Reflection to Write a Data Marshaler
* Using Reflection to Write a Data Marshaler
   	* The Go standard library lacks automatic CSV-to-struct mapping.
   	* **Goal:** Create a CSV marshaler/unmarshaler using reflection.
* **Defining the Struct API**
   	* Struct fields are annotated with csv tags.
   	* Marshal and Unmarshal functions map between CSV slices and struct slices
* Implement Marshal
   	* Ensures input is a slice of structs.
   	* Extracts headers from struct field tags.
   	* Iterates over struct values, converts fields to strings using reflection.
* Helper Functions for Marshaling
   	* marshalHeader(vt reflect.Type): Extracts CSV tags as column names.
   	* marshalOne(vv reflect.Value): Converts struct fields to strings using reflect.Kind.
* Implement Unmarshal
   	* Ensures input is a pointer to a slice of structs.
   	* Uses the first row as a header for field mapping.
   	* Iterates over CSV rows, converts strings to the correct types, and appends structs to the slice.
* Helper Functions for Unmarshalling
   	* unmarshalOne(row []string, namePos map[string]int, vv reflect.Value): Converts CSV values to struct fields based on their types.
* Integration with csv Package
   	* Uses csv.NewReader and csv.NewWriter for reading/writing CSV files.
   	* Calls Unmarshal to parse CSV data into structs and Marshal to convert structs back into CSV.
### Build Function with Reflection to Automate Repetitive Tasks

* **Creating a Function Wrapper with Reflection**
   	* MakeTimedFunction(f any): Wraps any function to measure execution time
   	* Uses `reflect.MakeFunc` to generate a new function.
   	* Calls the original function using `reflect.Value.Call`.
```go
func timeMe(a int) int {
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(a) * time.Second)
    return a * 2
}
timed := MakeTimedFunction(timeMe).(func(int) int)
fmt.Println(timed(2))
```
* Caveats
   	* Generated functions can obscure program flow
   	* Reflection slows execution - use it only when necessary

### Use Reflection Only if it's Worthwhile
**Struct Creation and Reflection Limitations**
* **Dynamically Creating Structs**
   	* reflect.StructOf allows creating new struct types at runtime.
   	* Rarely useful outside of advanced use cases (e.g., memoization).
* **Reflection Cannot Create Methods**
   	* No way to add methods to a type via reflection.
   	* Cannot dynamically implement an interface.
* **When to Avoid Reflection**
   	* Reflection is powerful but slow.
   	* Use only when interacting with external data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, databases).
   	* Prefer generics or standard type assertions when possible.

## unsafe is Unsafe
* **Why Use unsafe?**
   	* The unsafe package allows direct memory manipulation, bypassing Go’s safety features.
   	* Commonly used for **system interoperability** and **performance optimization**.
   	* A study found **24%** of Go projects use unsafe, mostly for OS and C integration.
* **Key Features of unsafe**
   	* **unsafe.Pointer**: Can be cast between any pointer types.
   	* **uintptr**: An integer type that can be used for pointer arithmetic.
* **Common Patterns in unsafe Code**
   	* **Type Conversion**: Converting between types not normally compatible.
   	* **Memory Manipulation**: Directly modifying memory using pointers.

### Memory Layout Insights
* **Sizeof**: Returns the size (in bytes) of a type.
* **Offsetof**: Returns the memory offset of a field in a struct.
* **Field Alignment**:
   	* P**adding** is added for proper alignment.
   	* Reordering struct fields can optimize memory usage.
```go
type BoolInt struct { b bool; i int64 } // 16 bytes
type IntBool struct { i int64; b bool } // 16 bytes
```
* **Optimized ordering** reduces padding and memory usage.
### Using unsafe for Binary Data Conversion
* **For efficiency**, unsafe.Pointer can map binary data to Go structs.
* **Example: Network Packet Parsing**
```go
type Data struct {
    Value  uint32
    Label  [10]byte
    Active bool
}
```
* Reading binary data safely
```go
func DataFromBytes(b [16]byte) Data {
    d := Data{}
    d.Value = binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b[:4])
    copy(d.Label[:], b[4:14])
    d.Active = b[14] != 0
    return d
}
```
* Using unsafe for efficiency
```go
func DataFromBytesUnsafe(b [16]byte) Data {
    return *(*Data)(unsafe.Pointer(&b))
}
```

Handling Endianness
* CPUs store data in **little-endian** or **big-endian** formats.\
* Check system endianness
```go
var isLE = (*(*[2]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(new(uint16))))[0] == 0x00
```
* Reverse bytes if Needed
```go
if isLE {
    data.Value = bits.ReverseBytes32(data.Value)
}
```


### Unsafe Slices
* Convert struct to a slice
```go
func BytesFromDataUnsafeSlice(d Data) []byte {
    return unsafe.Slice((*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&d)), unsafe.Sizeof(d))
}
```
* Convert slice to struct
```go
func DataFromBytesUnsafeSlice(b []byte) Data {
    return *(*Data)(unsafe.Pointer(unsafe.SliceData(b)))
}
```

### Performance Comparison
* **Using unsafe can significantly reduce execution time**.
* Example benchmarks on Apple Silicon M1:
   	* BenchmarkBytesFromData: **2.185 ns/op**
   	* BenchmarkBytesFromDataUnsafe: **0.8418 ns/op**
## Cgo is for Integration, Not Performance
* what is cgo ?
   	* cgo is Go’s **Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for C**, used to call C libraries.
   	* **Not meant for performance optimizations**, only for integration.
* why use cgo ?
   	* **Interoperability**: Used when no Go equivalent library exists.
   	* **Access to OS APIs and C libraries**: Many system-level libraries are written in C.
* How cgo works
   	* Go can call C functions by embedding C code inside special comments:
```go
/*
    #cgo LDFLAGS: -lm
    #include <math.h>
*/
import "C"
fmt.Println(C.sqrt(100))
```
* The **C pseudopackage** (C.int, C.char) allows type compatibility.

### Calling Go from C
* Use //export before a Go function to expose it to C:
```go
//export doubler
func doubler(i int) int {
    return i * 2
}
```

* Requires _cgo_export.h in C code:
```C
#include "_cgo_export.h"
```

Memory Management Challenges
* Go has garbage collection, C does not.
* Cannot pass Go structs with pointers directly to C.
* Go pointers cannot be stored in C after the function returns.

**Solution: Using cgo.Handle**
* Used to wrap Go objects containing pointers before passing to C.
```go
p := Person{Name: "Jon", Age: 21}
C.in_c(C.uintptr_t(cgo.NewHandle(p)))
```
* In C, the handle is passed back to a Go function for safe use.

**cgo Performance Issues**
* **Calling C from Go is 29x slower** than a direct C-to-C call.
* **Go 1.21 benchmark**: cgo call overhead is **~40ns** on Intel Core i7-12700H.
* cgo has **processing and memory model mismatches** that prevent performance improvements.

When to use cgo
✅ Use cgo **only when necessary**, like:
* No equivalent Go library exists.
* A third-party cgo wrapper is unavailable.

❌ Avoid cgo for:
* *Performance optimizations (native Go is faster).
* **Simple tasks** that can be written in Go.
