# Go Tooling

## Using go run to Try out Small Programs
* Go is a compiled language, but go run allows executing source code directly without creating a binary.
* It compiles the program into a temporary directory, runs it, and deletes the binary afterward.
* Useful for testing small programs or treating Go like a scripting language.
## Adding Third-Party Tools with go install
* Installs Go programs from source repositories by downloading, compiling, and placing them in the Go binary directory.
* Requires specifying the package path with @version or @latest to avoid unintended behaviour.
* Default installation location is `$HOME/go/bin`, which should be added to the system’s PATH.
* Default installation location is `$HOME/go/bin`, which should be added to the system’s PATH.

#### Environment Variables in Go
* GOROOT (Go installation directory) and GOPATH (workspace for Go code) are automatically managed; manual configuration is usually unnecessary.
* GOBIN can be set to customise where installed binaries are stored.
* go help environment lists all available environment variables.

#### Updating Installed Tools
* Running go install with @latest updates an installed tool to the newest version.
* Example: go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest updates hey.

#### Distribution of Go Programs
* go install is the preferred method for installing developer tools but is not mandatory for distribution.
* Binaries built using go build can be shared separately.

## Improving Import Formatting with goimports
* `goimports` also cleans up import statements, puts them in alphabetical order, removes unused imports and tries to guess any unspecified imports.
* `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest`
* `goimports -l -w .`

## Using Code-Quality Scanners
* `go vet` is a built-in tool that scans for common programming errors.
* Third-party linters help check code style and detect potential bugs missed by `go vet`
* Linters enforce idiomatic Go practices, such as
   	* Properly naming variables
   	* Formatting error messages correctly.
   	* Adding comments to public methods and types.
* While linting suggestions aren't always mandatory, following them helps maintain readable and consistent code.

### Best Practices When Using Linters
* Linters may produce *false positives* or *false negatives* - review their suggestions before applying changes
* If ignoring a linter warning, add a comment explaining why for future reference
* Each linter provides a different format for disabling specific warnings - check the documentation
### staticcheck
* One of the best third-party scanners with over *150 checks*
* Minimizes false positives and is widely supported
* `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest`\
* `staticcheck ./...`
* Example issue detected by `staticcheck` but not by `go vet`:
```go
s := fmt.Sprintf("Hello")
fmt.Println(s)

// staticcheck ./...
// main.go:6:7: unnecessary use of fmt.Sprintf (S1039)
```
* Another example: Detecting unused assignments to `err`.
### revive
* successor to `golint`, providing style and quality checks
* Installation: `go install github.com/mgechev/revive@latest`
* Default Checks include
   	* Missing comments on exported identifiers.
   	* Improper naming conventions.
   	* Incorrect ordering of return values.
* Customizable via configuration files (`.toml`). Example:
```toml
[rule.redefines-builtin-id]
```
* Example issue detected by `revive`:
```go
true := false
fmt.Println(true)

// revive -config built_in.toml ./...
// main.go:6:2: assignment creates a shadow of built-in identifier true
```
### golangcli-lint
* **Aggregates multiple linters** into a single tool (includes `go vet`, `staticcheck`, `revive`, etc.).
* Efficient and configurable.
* Installation (recommended via binary download): Follow instructions on the official site.
* `golangci-lint run`
* Example Issue Detection
```go
x := 10
x = 30
// golangci-lint run
// main.go:6:2: ineffectual assignment to x (ineffassign)
```
* Supports advanced shadowing checks with `.golangci.yml`
```yaml
linters:
  enable:
    - govet
    - predeclared
linters-settings:
  govet:
    check-shadowing: true
    settings:
      shadow:
        strict: true
    enable-all: true
```

#### Choosing a Right Linter for Your Team

| Tool            | Best For                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `go vet`        | Basic, built-in checks                              |
| `staticcheck`   | Comprehensive analysis with minimal false positives |
| `revive`        | Style and naming conventions with configurability   |
| `golangci-lint` | Running multiple linters efficiently                |
|                 |                                                     |

### Recommendations
* Start with `go vet` in your automated builds
* Add `staticcheck` for deeper analysis with fewer false positives
* Use `revive` if you need customizable rules for code quality
* Adopt `golangci-lint` once you're comfortable managing multiple linters
* Standardize configuration and commit them to source control to maintain consistency across developers
## Using govulncheck to Scan for Vulnerable Dependencies
* `govulncheck` scans through dependencies and finds known vulnerabilities in both the standard library and in third-party libraries imported modules.
* Installation: `go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest`
* To fix vulnerability : `go get -u=patch gopkg.in/yaml.v2`
* `govulncheck ./...`
* Ideally should be randomly changed or updated as it may break compatibility for your package.
## Embedding Content in Your Program
* Ideally all required files might be put in a directory and binary that go compiles can read from the directory.
* In some scenarios you may want to embed those files for distribution in the binary using `go:embed`
* Example: embedding list of most common 1000 passwords,
   	* import `embed` package
   	* magic comment `//go:embed <file_name>` embeds the content of a file in the variables
```go
package main

import (
    _ "embed"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

//go:embed passwords.txt
var passwords string

func main() {
    pwds := strings.Split(passwords, "\n")
    if len(os.Args) > 1 {
        for _, v := range pwds {
            if v == os.Args[1] {
                fmt.Println("true")
                os.Exit(0)
            }
        }
        fmt.Println("false")
    }
}
```
* To embed one or more directories of files into your program, use a variable of type `embed.FS` which implements three interfaces defined in `io/fs` package : `FS`, `ReadDirFS` and `ReadFileFS`.
* `embed.FS` can represent a virtual file system this way.
* In additional to exact file and directory names, we can use wildcards and ranges as well in embed
```go
// Example of hel based on the file present
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
    "io/fs"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

//go:embed help
var helpInfo embed.FS

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) == 1 {
        printHelpFiles()
        os.Exit(0)
    }
    data, err := helpInfo.ReadFile("help/" + os.Args[1])
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

```txt
$ **go build**
$ **./help_system**
contents:
advanced/topic1.txt
advanced/topic2.txt
info.txt

$ **./help_system advanced/topic1.txt**
This is advanced topic 1.

$ **./help_system advanced/topic3.txt**
open help/advanced/topic3.txt: file does not exist
```
## Embedding Hidden Files
* hidden files in directory tree that start with `.` or `_` are difficult to embed. Default Embedding ignores them.
* This behaviour can be override by 2 methods
   	* put `/*` after the name of a directory you want to embed (does not include hidden files in subdirectory)
   	* `all:` includes all files
```go
//go:embed parent_dir
var noHidden embed.FS

//go:embed parent_dir/*
var parentHiddenOnly embed.FS

//go:embed all:parent_dir
var allHidden embed.FS
```

## Using go generate
* `go generate` scans Go source files for special comments (`//go:generate ...) and executes the specified commands
* Typically used for **code generation** tasks, such as creating Go source files from schemas or definitions
* **Example: Generating Go Code from Protobuf**
   	* Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) is a binary format used for data serialization.
   	* Define a schema (.proto file), then use protoc and protoc-gen-go to generate Go code.
   	* `//go:generate protoc -I=. --go_out=. --go_opt=module=github.com/learning-go/proto_generate person.proto`
   	* Run with $ go generate ./..., which generates a .pb.go file with the necessary structs and methods.
* Using stringer for Enums
   	* Go’s iota does not provide automatic string representations for enums.
   	* stringer generates a .go file that implements String() for enum values.
   	* Example command: `//go:generate stringer -type=Direction`
   	* Running $ go generate ./... creates direction_string.go, allowing enums to be printed as strings.
* **Other Use Cases for go generate**
   	* Generating mocks for testing.
   	* Embedding assets or templates.
   	* Automating repetitive code transformations.

## Working with go generate and Makefiles
* go generate is used to mechanically create source code (e.g., for protobufs, stringer).
* It should be included in version control for transparency and easier builds.
* Best practice: Automate go generate in the Makefile to avoid forgetting to update generated code.
* Avoid automating it if it generates different outputs for identical inputs or takes too long.
## Reading the Build Info Inside a Go Binary
* go build embeds build info in the binary, including module versions and Git revision.
* Use `go version -m <binary>` to inspect this metadata.
* govulncheck can scan Go binaries for known vulnerabilities.
* This helps in tracking software versions and dependencies in production environments.
## Building Go Binary for Other Platforms
* Go supports cross-compilation using GOOS and GOARCH environment variables.
* Example: GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build builds a Linux binary on macOS.
* Supported OS/architecture combinations can be found in Go’s documentation.
## Using Build Tags
* Used for conditional compilation based on OS, architecture, Go version, or custom flags.
* Two methods:
   	* **Filename convention** (e.g., file_linux.go for Linux-specific code).
   	* **Build tags** (`//go:build <condition>` before package declaration).
* Custom build tags allow selective compilation with -tags flag (e.g., `go build -tags customtag`).
## Testing Version of Go
* Use `go install golang.org/dl/go<version>@latest` to install different Go versions.
* Run `go<version>` download and use `go<version> build` to test compatibility. Ex : `go1.19.2 build`
* Uninstall by deleting the Go version from the sdk directory.
