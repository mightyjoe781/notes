#### Minetest’s Forks & Games

##### **Multicraft**

Created by Maksym as an attempt to develop a “ready-made” game that has a nice interface and doesn’t require the player to have any development skills and just wants to play.

Most of famous servers currently run on multicraft because of availability of players and support for both 0.4 and 5.x clients. Most of mods may require little bit of tweaking for working with multicraft.

##### **Mineclone** 2 Game

Created by Wuzzy, as the name suggests game attempts to provide a gameplay similar to MineCraft. It has really come quite far and its very stable.

##### Final Minetest

Created by Robert Kiraly, provides improvements to original minetest game in terms of speed and completeness. It has been used as an education tool for school in Italy.

Some quite interesting feature offered are free hosting (limited), P2P server lists, 64x64 skins.

#### Alternate Free Hosting Solutions

- Old personal computer as a server
- Raspberry Pi
