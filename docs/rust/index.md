### Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on **performance**, **type safety**, and **concurrency**. 

It is memory safe without use of a garbage collector or reference counter. It enforces memory safety and prevents concurrent data races during compilation using Rust’s “borrow checker” which track object lifetime of all references in program.
