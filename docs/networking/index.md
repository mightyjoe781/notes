# Networking

A computer network is a system of interconnected devices that communicate and share resources through established protocols and communication channels. _Small networks_ can connect devices within a single location, while _large networks_ span across continents and form the backbone of the internet.

The design of networks encompasses both theoretical foundations and practical implementations including network topologies, protocols, data transmission methods, security mechanisms, and distributed system challenges such as routing, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
