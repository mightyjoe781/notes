## Guide to Scales

* **Practice Slow, Accuracy is very important to learn scales.**

* Once all 5 patterns of major scale are prepared
    * Practice all down picks
    * Practice alternate picking - write guide on alternate picking
* proceed to learn minor scale
    * Notice how these are just the same patterns but root notes are on different fingers.
* Focus and consolidate learning, learn about underlying root notes
    * Focus primarily on how starting at a note, makes the scale major for that note - write guide on learning fretboard
* This is probably good time to learn notes on the fretboard, and keeps track of root note, 3rd, 5th and 7th note in the scale practice.
* Once accuracy is 100%, start practicing scales more melodically
    * try to mix fingers, and try to use 1 finger per note method to improve melodic sounds
    * try to add delays, slides to add effect
* Think of all 5 patterns as a cohesive single pattern and practice
* Start blending into patterns,
    * first start with blending from root notes using slides
    * later start blending from all 6 strings, keep in mind of the note order
* Start Major Scale in 3rds Practice, 3rds tend to more melodic so guiding your fingers using this exercise will make you sound more melodic rather than simple scales up and down.
