# Music Theory Basics

## A helpful message :)

As a self-taught guitarist I think biggest issues you will face will be having a practice schedule and motivation to work on it.

In my early days of learning music, I regret that I appreciated music without developing a keen sense of what constitutes good or bad music. Perhaps I wasn't naturally gifted with a great sense of music, but I've come to realize that musical perception is relative and can be cultivated through practice. Over time, as I've practiced and listened to the same open chords repeatedly, my brain has instinctively started discerning nuances in those chords.

As you progress on your musical journey, you too will develop a sense of what resonates as good or bad music to you. It's important not to label yourself as tone-deaf or blindly follow guides or influencers. Stay open to experimentation and trust in your evolving musical instincts. With dedication and exploration, your musical understanding will grow richer and more nuanced.

Listen closely to what you play, as even the simplest techniques can evoke deep emotions in people. Music isn't about crafting the most complex symphonies or using the most complicated hand techniques to perform summning jutsu; it's about touching the emotions of others. Experience music rather than merely performing it.

I've expressed this enough, but remember, one of the greatest motivations for playing guitar is the ability to evoke emotion—whether it's joyous or sorrowful, uplifting or contemplative. Let the guitar resonate within you; don't just play it, feel it.

## Musical Alphabets

* Broadly in western music there are 12 notes & 7 musical alphabets (Natural Notes).

```
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
```

## Notes and Intervals

* Each of these natural notes have few half notes in between of them referred to as `sharp` or `flat`
* `x#` ~ read as `x sharp` or `yb` ~ read as `y flat`
* All natural notes are notes without sharps or flats and are 2 semintones away from each other except `BC` and `EF`

````
A
A# or Bb
B
C
C# or Db
D
D# or Eb
E
F
F# or Gb
G
G# or Ab
````

* Example `A` and `D` are 5 semintones away. (often referred to as Perfect 4th)
* Example `G` and `D` are 7 semintones away. (Note: order is cyclic) (This interval is Perfect 5th)
* Individual notes themselves doesn’t produce music, its the order of notes and interval between them or sometimes combination of notes which is responsible for music/emotion associated with them.
