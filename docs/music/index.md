# Music

### Preface

Following this guide should be used as a reference for experienced players and a good starting point for beginners. Although this guide seems like a comprehensive list of multiple topics, it barely scratches the surface of the iceberg of music.

If you can master most of the basic topics here, that should ideally put you ahead of 70% of guitarists. This guide essentially tries to encompass my journey into music and serves as a reference notebook for me.

To err is human, and I humbly acknowledge that this music guide might contain some imperfections. I kindly ask you to appreciate the effort put into this resource and report any mistakes or suggestions to my repository. Thank you for your support, and happy playing!

PS: I do love to talk about music, so you might find a lot of content where I'm talking to myself :)
