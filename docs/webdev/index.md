Following notes cover various frontend/backend related framework. Usually I don't trouble documenting frontends due to their too often changes. But if this section grows beyond separation maybe each Backend will get its own sections.
For most frontends React would be a gold standard, of course we have multiple Javascript Frameworks for this.

For Backend Primarily Springboot is standard in Industry so it makes sense to study it. While Python Backends could quite useful for rapid prototyping and some even usable in productions. Further we can have few Go backends for performant network requests.
