# Performance Tuning

## Indirect Performance Enhancements

### Design Choices

- Although its an obvious way to optimize performance, often we don’t prioritize this step. It helps in writing better Spark applications which run stable and consistent manner.

#### Scala vs Java vs Python vs R

- Its nearly impossible to choose one over other, but depends on use cases.
- If we want to perform some single-node machine learning after performing a large ETL job, run ETL as SparkR and then use R’s massive machine learning ecosystem to run single-node machine learning algorithms.
- Spark’s Structured API are consistent across language in terms of stability and speed.
- When you start delving in RDDs or UDFs, then R or Python are not best choice simple because how its executed, additionally its hard to provide type guarantees
