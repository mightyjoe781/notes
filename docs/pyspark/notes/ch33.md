# Ecosystem and Community

## Spark Packages 

Spark has a package repository for packages specific to Spark: [Spark Packages](https://spark-packages.org/). packages are libraries for Spark applications that can easily be shared with the community. [GraphFrames](http://graphframes.github.io/) is a perfect example; it makes graph analysis available on Spark’s  structured APIs in ways much easier to use than the lower-level (GraphX) API built into Spark

Healthcare and genomics have seen a surge in opportunity for big data applications. For example, the [ADAM Project](http://bdgenomics.org/) leverages unique, internal optimizations to Spark’s Catalyst engine to provide a scalable API & CLI for genome processing.

Another package, [Hail](https://hail.is/), is an open source, scalable framework for exploring and analyzing  genomic data. Starting from sequencing or microarray data in VCF and  other formats, Hail provides scalable algorithms to enable statistical  analysis of gigabyte-scale data on a laptop or terabyte-scale data on  cluster.
