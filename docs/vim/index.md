# Vim

Vim, an abbreviation of Vi IMproved, is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor. It is an enhanced clone of Bill Joy's vi. Bram Moolenaar, the author of Vim, developed it from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga and released a public version in 1991. Vim is designed for use from both a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface.
