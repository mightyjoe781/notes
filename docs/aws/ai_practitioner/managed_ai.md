## Amazon Mechanical Turk

- Crowdsourcing marketplace to perform simple human tasks
- Distributed virtual workforce
- Example:
    - You have a dataset of 10,000,000 images and you want to labels these images
    - You distribute the task on Mechanical Turk and humans will tag those images
    - You set the reward per image (for example $0.10 per image)
- Use cases: image classification, data collection, business processing
- Integrates with Amazon A2I, SageMaker Ground Truthâ€¦

## Amazon Augment AI (A2I)

- Human oversight of ML prediction in productions
    - Can be your own employees, over 500,000 contractors from AWS or AWS Mechanical Turk
    - Some vendors are pre-screened for confidentiality requirements
- The ML model can be built on AWS or elsewhere (SageMaker; Rekognition...)
