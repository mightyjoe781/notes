## Understanding Cloud Computing

### Traditional Data Centers

 Traditional Data Centers requires : 

- Large up-front investment
- forecasting demand is difficult
- slow to deploy new data centers and servers
- maintaining data centers is expensive
- you own all of the security and compliance burden

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expenses
- benefits from massive economies of scale
- stop guessing capacity
- increase speed and agility
- stop spending money maintaining data centers
- go global in minutes

**Elasticity** is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to do this automatically.

**Reliability**

**Agility** : The cloud lowers the cost of trying new ideas of business processes.

### Fundamentals of Cloud Computing

**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, application, and other IT resources through cloud services resources through cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Cloud Computing Models

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Max Control, Max Maintenance
- PaaS (Platform as a Service): Beanstalk
- SaaS(Software as a Service): Min Maintenance, Min Control

Cloud Deployment Models

- Public Cloud : Deployed onto a public cloud provider like AWS
- On-Premises (Private Cloud) : Cloud-like platform in a private data center.
- Hybrid (Cloud applications connected to a private data center)
