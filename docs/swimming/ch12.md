# Endurance & Efficiency

## Interval training

* Swim a set distance multiple times with rest intervals (e.g., 4 × 50m with 20s rest).
* Builds stamina and improves pacing.
* Can be stroke-specific or mixed.
* Use a pace clock or timer to track rest and work intervals.

## Pacing and breathing control

* Focus on even stroke rhythm to avoid early fatigue.
* Start slow and increase speed gradually.
* Practice controlled breathing patterns (e.g., breathe every 3 or 5 strokes).
* Learn to calm the breath during breaks and turns.

## Efficient turns and transitions

* Flip/open turns executed with minimal hesitation.

* Streamline and dolphin kicks after every wall push-off.

* Transitions between strokes or lengths should be smooth and intentional.

## Stroke correction for less drag

* Keep body aligned and avoid excessive side-to-side movement.
* Hands enter water cleanly — no splashing.
* Minimize head and shoulder lift.
* Improve kick efficiency — small, quick kicks from hips.
