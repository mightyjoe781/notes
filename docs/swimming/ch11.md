# Diving & Entry

## Pool entry techniques

* **Sitting Dive**: Sit on edge, push off gently into streamline.
* **Kneeling Dive**: One knee on edge, lean forward, push with hands.
* **Standing Dive**: Stand on edge, arms forward, dive smoothly into streamline.

## Streamlined entry position

* Arms extended forward, head tucked between arms.

* Legs together, body tight.

* Entry should be smooth with minimal splash.

## Safety checks before diving

* Always check **pool depth** (at least 8â€“9 feet for diving).

* Ensure no one is in your path.

* Never dive into **shallow water** or without checking depth signage.

* Follow pool rules (no diving zones, feet-first areas, etc).
