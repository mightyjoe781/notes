## Swimming Strokes (Core 4)

## **Freestyle (Front Crawl)**

- Entry, pull, kick, breathing, and timing
    - **Entry**: Hand enters water smoothly, not slapping surface.
    - **Pull**: High elbow underwater, pull efficiently.
    - **Kick**: Continuous flutter kick from hips.
    - **Breathing**: Turn head to side, one goggle in water.
    - **Timing**: Smooth alternating arm and leg motion.

## **Backstroke**

- Arm alternation, back float, kick and head position
    - Face up, head still, hips high.
    - Arms alternate in a windmill motion.
    - Flutter kick keeps legs afloat and propels.
    - Eyes on ceiling, minimal head movement.
    - Maintain steady rhythm and roll with shoulders.

## **Breaststroke**

- Simultaneous arm & leg motion, timing, glide
    - Arms and legs move **simultaneously**.
    - Pull, breathe, kick, glide sequence.
    - Legs perform frog kick, arms sweep and press together.
    - Longer glide phase = better efficiency.

## **Butterfly** *(optional at early stages)*

- Dolphin kick, simultaneous arm recovery, rhythm
    - Simultaneous arm recovery and dolphin kick.
    - Two kicks per arm cycle: one during pull, one during recovery.
    - Requires rhythm, coordination, and strength.
    - Most energy-intensive stroke â€” try after mastering others.
