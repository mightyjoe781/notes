# Kicking Techniques

## Flutter kick (freestyle & backstroke)

* Small, continuous kicks from the **hips**, not knees.
* Legs should stay straight but loose.
* Ankles relaxed, toes pointed.
* Keep kicks **within the water line** — no big splashes.
* Try vertical kicking for strength practice.

## Frog kick (breaststroke)

* Legs pull in (heels toward butt), then **kick out and around** in a circular motion.
* Finish with legs snapping together and gliding.
* Key is **timing**: pull, breathe, kick, glide.
* Avoid letting knees go too wide — this causes drag.

## Dolphin kick (butterfly & underwater)

* Wave-like kick that begins from the **chest/core**, travels through hips to toes.
* Feet stay together and move like a fish tail.
* Used in butterfly stroke and **underwater streamline** after push-offs.
* Practice with arms extended in streamline to feel rhythm.

## Kickboard drills

* Use a kickboard to isolate leg movement and practice technique.
* Helps build leg strength and improve propulsion.
* Drills:
  * Front flutter kick
  * Side kick with breathing
  * Vertical kick (no board)
  * Dolphin kick on back/front
