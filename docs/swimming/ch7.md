# Arm Movements

## Freestyle arm cycle (catch → pull → push → recovery)

* **Catch**: Hand enters water in line with shoulder, fingers slightly apart.
* **Pull**: Bend elbow underwater, pull hand down and back toward the chest.
* **Push**: Extend arm past the hip to finish the stroke.
* **Recovery**: Lift elbow high, hand relaxed, swing arm forward over water.

## Backstroke arm cycle

* One arm enters the water as the other exits.
* Entry with little finger first, arm straight.
* Pull straight down with slight bend at elbow, past the hip.
* Recovery: Arm comes out thumb-first, rotates to re-enter pinky-first.

## Breaststroke arm sweep (outward → inward → glide)

* Arms start together in front.
* Sweep outward and slightly downward to shoulder width.
* Pull hands inward under the chest, forming a heart shape.
* Glide forward with arms extended and body streamlined.

## Butterfly arm recovery and pull

* Both arms move together — wide and powerful.
* Pull down and outward, forming a keyhole pattern under the body.
* Recover both arms over the water in a circular motion.
* Requires coordination with dolphin kick and breathing rhythm.

## Timing arm strokes with breathing

* Freestyle: Inhale as one arm recovers, exhale underwater.
* Breaststroke: Breathe during arm pull, glide before next stroke.
* Backstroke: Breathe naturally as face stays out of water.
* Butterfly: Inhale during pull phase, exhale during recovery.
