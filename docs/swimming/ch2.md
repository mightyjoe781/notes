# Water Safety Fundamentals

## Importance of lifeguards and supervision

* Lifeguards are trained to respond quickly to emergencies — always swim in their presence if possible.
* They monitor pool behavior, enforce rules, and can perform rescues or first aid.
* Never swim alone — even confident swimmers can face cramps or sudden fatigue.
* For kids and beginners, constant adult supervision is critical, even in shallow water.

## Understanding pool depths and signage

* Always read depth markers present at pool
* Shallow areas are meant for standing, wading, or beginner practice.
* Deep ends should only be used if you’re confident in floating/treading and recovery skills.
* Obey **“No Diving”** signs — diving into shallow water can cause serious injury.
* Pay attention to **lane signs** or designations (e.g., lap swim, leisure zone).

## Safe pool entry and exit

* Steps or ladders**: Always enter slowly using handrails.**
* **Sitting or kneeling entry**: Safer for beginners and helps adjust to water temperature. Alternately you can walk around the pool.
* **Walk, don’t jump** unless you’re certain of depth and safety.
* Use **pool walls or grab rails** for exiting — avoid pulling on lane ropes or other swimmers.
* Be cautious of **wet floors** around the pool — slip hazard!

## Emergency response basics

* Know where lifebuoys, rescue hooks, and first aid kits are located.
* In an emergency, call for help immediately — alert a lifeguard or adult.
    * Don’t attempt to rescue someone by jumping in unless trained — use reach, throw, don’t go:
    * Reach with a pole or arm (lie down to avoid being pulled in).
    * Throw a floatation device or rope.
* Learn basic CPR and rescue breathing — can be life-saving before help arrives.
