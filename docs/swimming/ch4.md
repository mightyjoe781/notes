## Body Position & Balance

## Horizontal body alignment

* Your body should stay as **flat** as possible on the water surface.
* Eyes look down (not forward) to keep the neck aligned with the spine.
* Hips should stay near the surface — avoid letting legs sink.
* A good horizontal position reduces **drag** and conserves energy.

## Streamline position (arms extended, body tight)

* Arms fully extended above the head, hands overlapped.
* Biceps close to ears, elbows locked straight.
* Body long and tight — like an arrow.
* Used after push-offs, dives, and between strokes for speed and glide.

## Relaxation and buoyancy awareness

* Tension = sinking. Relax your muscles to float better.
* Test buoyancy by gently holding a deep breath and letting your body rise.
* Try floating in a star or back float position with relaxed breathing.
* Trust the water to support your body — especially in saltwater or pools with higher buoyancy.

## Core engagement for balance

* Use your **core muscles** (abs, lower back) to stay stable.
* A strong core keeps hips from sinking and helps with stroke power.
* Practice gentle tightening of the core while floating or kicking.
* Think of “pulling your belly button toward your spine.”
