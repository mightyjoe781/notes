# Breathing Techniques

## Basic breath control & timing

* Never hold your breath too long — focus on **rhythmic breathing**.

* Exhale **in the water**, inhale **out of the water**.
* Build a habit: Inhale → stroke → exhale in water → repeat.

## Side breathing for freestyle

* Turn your head **with your body roll**, not separately.
* Breathe in quickly when mouth clears the water, then return head down.
* One goggle should stay underwater during the breath.
* Practice bilateral breathing (both sides) for balance and endurance.

## Exhaling underwater

* Essential to avoid gasping or panic.
* Exhale **slowly and continuously** through nose or mouth underwater.
* Use bubbles as a cue — no bubbles = no breathing!
* Helps you stay calm and reduces CO₂ buildup.

## 2-3-2 breathing pattern

* A useful rhythm for beginners:
  * Inhale → swim 2 strokes → exhale
  * Inhale → swim 3 strokes → exhale
  * Inhale → swim 2 strokes → exhale
* Helps you learn to **control breathing pace** and avoid panic.

## Nose clip vs. no clip usage

* Nose clips can help beginners feel more confident while exhaling.

* Good for underwater work, flip turns, and floating.

* Long-term goal: learn to **exhale naturally through the nose** without a clip.
