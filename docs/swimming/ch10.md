# Turns & Push-offs

## Open turn technique

- Used in breaststroke and butterfly.
- Touch wall with both hands → turn body quickly → push off in streamline.

## Flip turns (freestyle & backstroke)

* Tuck and somersault as you approach wall.
* Feet plant on wall, push off in streamline.
* Fast, continuous momentum, reduces time spent at wall.

## Breaststroke & butterfly turns

* Must touch wall **with both hands** simultaneously.
* After touch, perform open turn and push off into glide and stroke.

## Wall push-off with streamline

* Arms extended, body tight, head tucked between biceps.
* Push off with legs, glide before resuming strokes.
* Essential for fast transitions after turn or dive.
