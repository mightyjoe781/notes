Swimming is a very important life-saving skill that should be known all folks. Some people grew up in suburban areas with no accessibility to pools or water areas should try to learn it from a certified coach.

I always wanted to learn swimming, atleast enough to come to shore in emergency situations :) or maybe just played too many games. This guide documents important aspects of swimming and correct techniques often neglected by beginners. This content should be usable for beginner & intermediate swimmers.
