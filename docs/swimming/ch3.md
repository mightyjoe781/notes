# Getting Comfortable in Water

## Submerging face & blowing bubbles

* NOTE: A very basic beginner mistake is holding the breath underwater which is incorrect way for swimmers. Its usually taught to increase lung capacity initially, but some people think thats the way.
* First step to overcoming water fear and gaining control over breathing.
* Start by standing in shallow water and gently lower your face.
* Exhale through the **nose and mouth** to make bubbles.
* Focus on staying relaxed and not holding your breath tightly.
* Try humming or saying “boo” underwater to learn steady exhale.
* Practice repeatedly until it feels natural and calm.

## Water confidence drills

* **Face dips**: Inhale above water, dip your face in, exhale, repeat.
* **Wall holds**: Hold onto the edge, practice submerging your face and kicking.
* **Crocodile walk**: Walk forward with chest and face low in the water.
* **Jump and blow**: Lightly jump into shallow water and immediately blow bubbles.
* These drills reduce anxiety and help your body adapt to the sensation of being submerged.

## Breath holding and control (nose and mouth) - warmup

* Goal: Hold breath without panic and control exhale while submerged.
* Inhale deeply, submerge, hold for 3–5 seconds, then slowly exhale through the nose.
* Practice timing: Inhale above water → hold → exhale underwater.
* Try holding your breath while floating to combine skills.
* Use a nose clip if necessary, but try to wean off with practice.

## Floating: Front float, back float, star float - day 1

* Floating builds trust in the water — you don’t need to constantly move to stay up!
* **Front Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvwDTY9Dp-Y&pp=ygUYZmxvYXRpbmcgaW4gd2F0ZXIgc2lrYW5h)
    * Extend arms forward, face in water, legs straight.
    * Push off gently from the wall or floor and hold still.
* **Back Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emigiKZBWo&pp=ygUYZmxvYXRpbmcgaW4gd2F0ZXIgc2lrYW5h)
    * Lie on your back, keep hips high, arms out, head relaxed.
    * Look straight up and breathe calmly.
* **Star Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoZhSZvWEPc&pp=ygUKc3RhciBmbG9hdA%3D%3D)
    * Arms and legs stretched wide like a starfish.
    * Works for both front and back floats.
    * Stay calm and resist the urge to thrash or over-correct balance.

## Treading water (basic sculling + flutter kick)

* Combines small arm and leg movements to keep your head above water.
* **Sculling**:
    * Hands move in small figure-8 motions near your chest/waist level.
    * Palms angled to push water downward and outward.
* **Flutter Kick**:
    * Alternating up and down leg motion from hips, not knees.
    * Legs should stay relatively straight and relaxed.
    * Start in the shallow end or with a floatation aid.
    * Goal is to stay vertical with head above water using minimal effort.
