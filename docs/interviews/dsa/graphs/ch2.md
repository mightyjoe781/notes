# Graph Traversal

## DFS

- traverses graph in 'depth-first' manner
- Time Complexity
  - $O(V+E)$ : Adjacency List
  - $O(V^2)$ : Adjacency Matrix

```c++
const UNVISITED = -1;
const VISITED = 1;

vector<int> dfs_num;				// initially all set to unvisited

void dfs(int u) {
  dfs_num[u] = VISITED;
  for(auto v:adj[u]) {
    if(dfs_num[v] == UNVISITED)
       dfs(v);
  } }
```

## BFS

- traverses graph in 'breadth-first' manner
- Time Complexity
  - $O(V+E)$ : Adjacency List
  - $O(V^2)$ : Adjacency Matrix

````c++
// inside int main() -- no recursion
  vi d(V,INF); d[s] = 0;					// distance from source s to s is 0
  queue<int> q; q.push(s);

  while(!q.empty()) {
    int u = q.front(); q.pop();
    for(auto v:adj[u]) {
      if(d[v] == INF) {
        d[v] = d[u] + 1;
        q.push(v);
 } } }
````

## Connected Components

- Can be done using Union-Find and BFS also.

````c++
// inside int main()---this is the DFS solution
numCC = 0;
  dfs_num.assign(V, UNVISITED); // sets all vertices’ state to UNVISITED
  for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) // for each vertex i in [0..V-1]
  	if (dfs_num[i] == UNVISITED) // if vertex i is not visited yet
  	printf("CC %d:", ++numCC), dfs(i), printf("\n"); // 3 lines here!
````

## Flood Fill - Labeling/Coloring the Connected Components

This version actually counts the size of each component and colors it.

````c++
int dr[] = {1,1,0,-1,-1,-1, 0, 1}; // trick to explore an implicit 2D grid
int dc[] = {0,1,1, 1, 0,-1,-1,-1}; // S,SE,E,NE,N,NW,W,SW neighbors
int floodfill(int r, int c, char c1, char c2) { // returns the size of CC
  if (r < 0 || r >= R || c < 0 || c >= C) return 0; // outside grid
  if (grid[r][c] != c1) return 0; // does not have color c1
  int ans = 1; // adds 1 to ans because vertex (r, c) has c1 as its color
  grid[r][c] = c2; // now recolors vertex (r, c) to c2 to avoid cycling!
  for (int d = 0; d < 8; d++)
    ans += floodfill(r + dr[d], c + dc[d], c1, c2);
  return ans; // the code is neat due to dr[] and dc[]
}
````

NOTE: this direction traversal can be simple using `vector<vector<int>> dirs` to represent directions to traverse in.

## Cycle Detection
Approach should be based on Graph Type:

* Undirected Graph - *DFS with parent tracking*, *Union-Find*
* Directed Graph - Kahn’s Algorithm, *DFS with recursion Stack*

### DFS on Undirected Graph

**Key Idea**: During DFS, if you encounter a visited vertex that is not the parent of the current vertex (back-edge), a cycle exists.

````c++
bool dfs(int v, int parent, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<bool> &visited) {
    visited[v] = true;
    for (int neighbor : adj[v]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            if (dfs(neighbor, v, adj, visited))
                return true;
        } else if (neighbor != parent) // not a back-edge
            return true; // Cycle detected
    }
    return false;
}

bool hasCycleUndirected(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int n) {
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        if (!visited[i])
            if (dfs(i, -1, adj, visited))
                return true;
    return false;
}
````

### UNION-FIND TO Detect CyCLES

* NOTE: This is a simplified implementation of Union-Find. Refer [Better Union-Find](ch5.md#Union-Find (Fastest Implementation))

````c++
class UnionFind {
    
public:
    vector<int> p;
    UnionFind(int n) {
        p.resize(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            p[i] = i;
    }
    int find(int x) {
        if(p[x] != x)
            return p[x] = find(p[x]);	// path compression
        return x;
    }
    bool unite(int x, int y) {
        int px = find(x);
        int py = find(y);
        if(px == py)
            return false;
        p[px] = py;
        return true;
    }
};

// inside main function
bool isCycle(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    UnionFind uf(n);
    for(auto e: edges) {
        if(!uf.unite(e[0], e[1]))
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
````



### Kahn’s Algorithm

* NOTE: Same algorithm with minor changes, can be used to give Topological Order.

````c++
bool hasCycleKahn(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int n) {
    vector<int> inDegree(n, 0);

    // Calculate in-degree
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        for (int neighbor : adj[i])
            inDegree[neighbor]++;

  	// put zero-indegree nodes in on queue
    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        if (inDegree[i] == 0)
            q.push(i);

    int count = 0; // Number of processed nodes
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int v = q.front(); q.pop();
        count++;

        for (int neighbor : adj[v]) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0)
                q.push(neighbor);
        }
    }
    return count != n; // Cycle exists if not all vertices are processed
}
````

### DFS on Directed Graph

* NOTE: This is little tricky implementation, its better to learn Kahn’s Algorithm for cycle detection in DFS Graphs.

we need to keep track of path we used to come to a node. Without recStack, the algorithm cannot identify back edges properly, which are a key indicator of cycles in a directed graph.

In a directed graph, a **back edge** points from a node to one of its ancestors in the current DFS path.

Here visited only keeps track of nodes that have been explored, for example if you again run dfs on different node but come across a node that is visited doesn’t mean it is forming a cycle but rec Stack keeps track of that.

````c++
1 → 2 → 3 → 4
    ↘   ↗
      5
  
// above graph lets say traverses straight from 1->2->3->4->5, marks everything visited.
// when branching again happens at 2, we see wait 3 is marked visited, this should not happen there fore its important to keep track of current path.

bool dfsDirected(int v, vector<vector<int>> &adj, vector<bool> &visited, vector<bool> &recStack) {
    visited[v] = true;
    recStack[v] = true;

    for (int neighbor : adj[v]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            if (dfsDirected(neighbor, adj, visited, recStack))
                return true;
        } else if (recStack[neighbor]) {
            return true; // Cycle detected
        }
    }

    recStack[v] = false;
    return false;
}

bool hasCycleDirected(vector<vector<int>> &adj, int n) {
    vector<bool> visited(n, false);
    vector<bool> recStack(n, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)			// check all nodes
        if (!visited[i])
            if (dfsDirected(i, adj, visited, recStack))
                return true;
    return false;
}
````

### Bipartite(or 2/bi-colorable) Graph Check

````c++
// inside int main()
  queue<int> q; q.push(s);
  vi color(V, INF); color[s] = 0;
  bool isBipartite = true; // addition of one boolean flag, initially true
  while (!q.empty() & isBipartite) { // similar to the original BFS routine
    int u = q.front(); q.pop();
    for (int j = 0; j < (int)AdjList[u].size(); j++) {
      ii v = AdjList[u][j];
      if (color[v.first] == INF) { // but, instead of recording distance,
        color[v.first] = 1 - color[u]; // we just record two colors {0, 1}
        q.push(v.first); }
      else if (color[v.first] == color[u]) { // u & v.first has same color
      	isBipartite = false; break; } } } // we have a coloring conflict
````

#### Number of Distinct Islands

This problem requires identifying the shapes of the encountered island. The way to approach this problem is creating a **canonical hash** for the dfs we perform on each island.

Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-islands/

Given a 2D array grid 0’s and 1’s island as a group of 1’s representing land connected by 4-neighbors.

Count number of distinct islands. An island is considered to be same  as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not  rotated/reflected) to equal the other.

Hmm make a island into a string xD and then store it in the map (kind of like serialization) , now for each island check before whether its  stored in map then its not distinct and don’t count it in result.

Now how to serialize : Create a traversal strings representing traversal DRLU representing the down,right,left,up!

````c++
  vector<vector<int>> dirs = {{0, 1, 'R'}, {1, 0, 'U'}, {-1, 0, 'L'}, {0, -1, 'D'}};
  void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int i, int j, vector<vector<bool>>& visited,string& island){
      visited[i][j] = true;

      for(auto dir: dirs){
          // neighbors
          int x = i + dir[0];
          int y = j + dir[1];

          if(x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= grid.size()||
          y >= grid[0].size()||visited[x][y] || grid[x][y] == 0)
              continue;

          island += dir[2];
          dfs(grid, x, y, visited, island);      
      }
      island+="#";
  }
  int numDistinctIslands(vector<vector<int>>& grid){
      int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size(), i, j;
      unordered_set<string> islands;
      vector<vector<bool>> visited(m,vector<bool>(n,false));

      for(i = 0; i< m; i++){
          for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
              if(grid[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i][j]){
                  string island_pattern = "";
                  dfs(grid, i, j, visited, island_pattern);
                  islands.insert(island_pattern);
              }
      }
      return (int) islands.size();
  }
