# System Design
*The process of defining a system’s architecture, components, and interfaces to meet functional and non-functional requirements.*

**Key Aspects**
* Scalability
* Performance
* Reliability
* Maintainability
* Cost-effectiveness

## High Level Design (HLD) - Architecture & Strategy
* System Architecture - APIs, Databases, Caching, Load Balancing
* Technology Choices - SQL vs NoSQL, Monolith vs Microservices
* Data Flows - Request Handling, processing, storage flows
* Scalability & Fault Tolerance - Replication, Sharding, Failover
* Trade-offs & Bottlenecks - CAP Theorem, latency, cost

## Low-Level Design (LLD) - Implementation & Code
* Class Diagrams - Object-oriented structure
* Database Schema - Tables, indexing, query optimization
* API Design - REST, GraphQL, gRPC best practices
* [Design Patterns](lld/design_patterns.md) - Singleton, Factory, CQRS, Event-Driven
* Problem Implementations - Examples & Case Studies
