# Turns & Push-offs

## Open turn technique

- Used in breaststroke and butterfly.
- Touch wall with both hands ‚Üí turn body quickly ‚Üí push off in streamline.

## Flip turns (freestyle & backstroke)

* Tuck and somersault as you approach wall.
* Feet plant on wall, push off in streamline.
* Fast, continuous momentum, reduces time spent at wall.

## Breaststroke & butterfly turns

* Must touch wall **with both hands** simultaneously.
* After touch, perform open turn and push off into glide and stroke.

## Wall push-off with streamline

* Arms extended, body tight, head tucked between biceps.
* Push off with legs, glide before resuming strokes.
* Essential for fast transitions after turn or dive.

# Diving & Entry

## Pool entry techniques

* **Sitting Dive**: Sit on edge, push off gently into streamline.
* **Kneeling Dive**: One knee on edge, lean forward, push with hands.
* **Standing Dive**: Stand on edge, arms forward, dive smoothly into streamline.

## Streamlined entry position

* Arms extended forward, head tucked between arms.

* Legs together, body tight.

* Entry should be smooth with minimal splash.

## Safety checks before diving

* Always check **pool depth** (at least 8‚Äì9 feet for diving).

* Ensure no one is in your path.

* Never dive into **shallow water** or without checking depth signage.

* Follow pool rules (no diving zones, feet-first areas, etc).

# Endurance & Efficiency

## Interval training

* Swim a set distance multiple times with rest intervals (e.g., 4 √ó 50m with 20s rest).
* Builds stamina and improves pacing.
* Can be stroke-specific or mixed.
* Use a pace clock or timer to track rest and work intervals.

## Pacing and breathing control

* Focus on even stroke rhythm to avoid early fatigue.
* Start slow and increase speed gradually.
* Practice controlled breathing patterns (e.g., breathe every 3 or 5 strokes).
* Learn to calm the breath during breaks and turns.

## Efficient turns and transitions

* Flip/open turns executed with minimal hesitation.

* Streamline and dolphin kicks after every wall push-off.

* Transitions between strokes or lengths should be smooth and intentional.

## Stroke correction for less drag

* Keep body aligned and avoid excessive side-to-side movement.
* Hands enter water cleanly ‚Äî no splashing.
* Minimize head and shoulder lift.
* Improve kick efficiency ‚Äî small, quick kicks from hips.

## üõë Common Mistakes & Fixes

## Dropped elbow in freestyle

* Problem: Reduces power in pull.

* Fix: Keep elbow higher than hand during underwater pull.

## Over-rotation while breathing

* Problem: Body twists too much when turning head.
* Fix: Rotate only slightly; keep one goggle in the water.

## Overkicking or stiff legs

* Problem: Wastes energy, causes drag.

* Fix: Relax ankles, kick from hips with slight knee bend.

## Head lifting too much to breathe

* Problem: Sinks hips and disrupts flow.
* Fix: Turn head to side instead of lifting; mouth just above surface.

## Sinking hips or legs

* Problem: Increases resistance, slows speed.
* Fix: Engage core, keep eyes down, kick consistently.

# Water Safety Fundamentals

## Importance of lifeguards and supervision

* Lifeguards are trained to respond quickly to emergencies ‚Äî always swim in their presence if possible.
* They monitor pool behavior, enforce rules, and can perform rescues or first aid.
* Never swim alone ‚Äî even confident swimmers can face cramps or sudden fatigue.
* For kids and beginners, constant adult supervision is critical, even in shallow water.

## Understanding pool depths and signage

* Always read depth markers present at pool
* Shallow areas are meant for standing, wading, or beginner practice.
* Deep ends should only be used if you‚Äôre confident in floating/treading and recovery skills.
* Obey **‚ÄúNo Diving‚Äù** signs ‚Äî diving into shallow water can cause serious injury.
* Pay attention to **lane signs** or designations (e.g., lap swim, leisure zone).

## Safe pool entry and exit

* Steps or ladders**: Always enter slowly using handrails.**
* **Sitting or kneeling entry**: Safer for beginners and helps adjust to water temperature. Alternately you can walk around the pool.
* **Walk, don‚Äôt jump** unless you‚Äôre certain of depth and safety.
* Use **pool walls or grab rails** for exiting ‚Äî avoid pulling on lane ropes or other swimmers.
* Be cautious of **wet floors** around the pool ‚Äî slip hazard!

## Emergency response basics

* Know where lifebuoys, rescue hooks, and first aid kits are located.
* In an emergency, call for help immediately ‚Äî alert a lifeguard or adult.
  * Don‚Äôt attempt to rescue someone by jumping in unless trained ‚Äî use reach, throw, don‚Äôt go:
  * Reach with a pole or arm (lie down to avoid being pulled in).
  * Throw a floatation device or rope.
* Learn basic CPR and rescue breathing ‚Äî can be life-saving before help arrives.

# Getting Comfortable in Water

## Submerging face & blowing bubbles

* NOTE: A very basic beginner mistake is holding the breath underwater which is incorrect way for swimmers. Its usually taught to increase lung capacity initially, but some people think thats the way.
* First step to overcoming water fear and gaining control over breathing.
* Start by standing in shallow water and gently lower your face.
* Exhale through the **nose and mouth** to make bubbles.
* Focus on staying relaxed and not holding your breath tightly.
* Try humming or saying ‚Äúboo‚Äù underwater to learn steady exhale.
* Practice repeatedly until it feels natural and calm.

## Water confidence drills

* **Face dips**: Inhale above water, dip your face in, exhale, repeat.
* **Wall holds**: Hold onto the edge, practice submerging your face and kicking.
* **Crocodile walk**: Walk forward with chest and face low in the water.
* **Jump and blow**: Lightly jump into shallow water and immediately blow bubbles.
* These drills reduce anxiety and help your body adapt to the sensation of being submerged.

## Breath holding and control (nose and mouth) - warmup

* Goal: Hold breath without panic and control exhale while submerged.
* Inhale deeply, submerge, hold for 3‚Äì5 seconds, then slowly exhale through the nose.
* Practice timing: Inhale above water ‚Üí hold ‚Üí exhale underwater.
* Try holding your breath while floating to combine skills.
* Use a nose clip if necessary, but try to wean off with practice.

## Floating: Front float, back float, star float - day 1

* Floating builds trust in the water ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to constantly move to stay up!
* **Front Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvwDTY9Dp-Y&pp=ygUYZmxvYXRpbmcgaW4gd2F0ZXIgc2lrYW5h)
  * Extend arms forward, face in water, legs straight.
  * Push off gently from the wall or floor and hold still.
* **Back Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emigiKZBWo&pp=ygUYZmxvYXRpbmcgaW4gd2F0ZXIgc2lrYW5h)
  * Lie on your back, keep hips high, arms out, head relaxed.
  * Look straight up and breathe calmly.
* **Star Float**: [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoZhSZvWEPc&pp=ygUKc3RhciBmbG9hdA%3D%3D)
  * Arms and legs stretched wide like a starfish.
  * Works for both front and back floats.
  * Stay calm and resist the urge to thrash or over-correct balance.

## Treading water (basic sculling + flutter kick)

* Combines small arm and leg movements to keep your head above water.
* **Sculling**:
  * Hands move in small figure-8 motions near your chest/waist level.
  * Palms angled to push water downward and outward.
* **Flutter Kick**:
  * Alternating up and down leg motion from hips, not knees.
  * Legs should stay relatively straight and relaxed.
  * Start in the shallow end or with a floatation aid.
  * Goal is to stay vertical with head above water using minimal effort.

## Body Position & Balance

## Horizontal body alignment

* Your body should stay as **flat** as possible on the water surface.
* Eyes look down (not forward) to keep the neck aligned with the spine.
* Hips should stay near the surface ‚Äî avoid letting legs sink.
* A good horizontal position reduces **drag** and conserves energy.

## Streamline position (arms extended, body tight)

* Arms fully extended above the head, hands overlapped.
* Biceps close to ears, elbows locked straight.
* Body long and tight ‚Äî like an arrow.
* Used after push-offs, dives, and between strokes for speed and glide.

## Relaxation and buoyancy awareness

* Tension = sinking. Relax your muscles to float better.
* Test buoyancy by gently holding a deep breath and letting your body rise.
* Try floating in a star or back float position with relaxed breathing.
* Trust the water to support your body ‚Äî especially in saltwater or pools with higher buoyancy.

## Core engagement for balance

* Use your **core muscles** (abs, lower back) to stay stable.
* A strong core keeps hips from sinking and helps with stroke power.
* Practice gentle tightening of the core while floating or kicking.
* Think of ‚Äúpulling your belly button toward your spine.‚Äù

# Breathing Techniques

## Basic breath control & timing

* Never hold your breath too long ‚Äî focus on **rhythmic breathing**.

* Exhale **in the water**, inhale **out of the water**.
* Build a habit: Inhale ‚Üí stroke ‚Üí exhale in water ‚Üí repeat.

## Side breathing for freestyle

* Turn your head **with your body roll**, not separately.
* Breathe in quickly when mouth clears the water, then return head down.
* One goggle should stay underwater during the breath.
* Practice bilateral breathing (both sides) for balance and endurance.

## Exhaling underwater

* Essential to avoid gasping or panic.
* Exhale **slowly and continuously** through nose or mouth underwater.
* Use bubbles as a cue ‚Äî no bubbles = no breathing!
* Helps you stay calm and reduces CO‚ÇÇ buildup.

## 2-3-2 breathing pattern

* A useful rhythm for beginners:
  * Inhale ‚Üí swim 2 strokes ‚Üí exhale
  * Inhale ‚Üí swim 3 strokes ‚Üí exhale
  * Inhale ‚Üí swim 2 strokes ‚Üí exhale
* Helps you learn to **control breathing pace** and avoid panic.

## Nose clip vs. no clip usage

* Nose clips can help beginners feel more confident while exhaling.

* Good for underwater work, flip turns, and floating.

* Long-term goal: learn to **exhale naturally through the nose** without a clip.

# Kicking Techniques

## Flutter kick (freestyle & backstroke)

* Small, continuous kicks from the **hips**, not knees.
* Legs should stay straight but loose.
* Ankles relaxed, toes pointed.
* Keep kicks **within the water line** ‚Äî no big splashes.
* Try vertical kicking for strength practice.

## Frog kick (breaststroke)

* Legs pull in (heels toward butt), then **kick out and around** in a circular motion.
* Finish with legs snapping together and gliding.
* Key is **timing**: pull, breathe, kick, glide.
* Avoid letting knees go too wide ‚Äî this causes drag.

## Dolphin kick (butterfly & underwater)

* Wave-like kick that begins from the **chest/core**, travels through hips to toes.
* Feet stay together and move like a fish tail.
* Used in butterfly stroke and **underwater streamline** after push-offs.
* Practice with arms extended in streamline to feel rhythm.

## Kickboard drills

* Use a kickboard to isolate leg movement and practice technique.
* Helps build leg strength and improve propulsion.
* Drills:
  * Front flutter kick
  * Side kick with breathing
  * Vertical kick (no board)
  * Dolphin kick on back/front

## Common kick mistakes and fixes

* ‚ùå **Bending knees too much** ‚Äì Fix: Kick from hips.
* ‚ùå **Rigid ankles** ‚Äì Fix: Relax ankles and point toes.
* ‚ùå **Splashing too much** ‚Äì Fix: Reduce kick size.
* ‚ùå **Sinking legs** ‚Äì Fix: Engage core and improve body position.
* ‚ùå **Kicking too fast** ‚Äì Fix: Match kick rhythm with stroke.

# Arm Movements

## Freestyle arm cycle (catch ‚Üí pull ‚Üí push ‚Üí recovery)

* **Catch**: Hand enters water in line with shoulder, fingers slightly apart.
* **Pull**: Bend elbow underwater, pull hand down and back toward the chest.
* **Push**: Extend arm past the hip to finish the stroke.
* **Recovery**: Lift elbow high, hand relaxed, swing arm forward over water.

## Backstroke arm cycle

* One arm enters the water as the other exits.
* Entry with little finger first, arm straight.
* Pull straight down with slight bend at elbow, past the hip.
* Recovery: Arm comes out thumb-first, rotates to re-enter pinky-first.

## Breaststroke arm sweep (outward ‚Üí inward ‚Üí glide)

* Arms start together in front.
* Sweep outward and slightly downward to shoulder width.
* Pull hands inward under the chest, forming a heart shape.
* Glide forward with arms extended and body streamlined.

## Butterfly arm recovery and pull

* Both arms move together ‚Äî wide and powerful.
* Pull down and outward, forming a keyhole pattern under the body.
* Recover both arms over the water in a circular motion.
* Requires coordination with dolphin kick and breathing rhythm.

## Timing arm strokes with breathing

* Freestyle: Inhale as one arm recovers, exhale underwater.
* Breaststroke: Breathe during arm pull, glide before next stroke.
* Backstroke: Breathe naturally as face stays out of water.
* Butterfly: Inhale during pull phase, exhale during recovery.

Swimming is a very important life-saving skill that should be known all folks. Some people grew up in suburban areas with no accessibility to pools or water areas should try to learn it from a certified coach.

I always wanted to learn swimming, atleast enough to come to shore in emergency situations :) or maybe just played too many games. This guide documents important aspects of swimming and correct techniques often neglected by beginners. This content should be usable for beginner & intermediate swimmers.
