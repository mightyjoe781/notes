## Fundamental Analysis of a Stock

Parameters to evaluate a stock is a long list, which could be contradictory and even incorrect at times.

It is inherently difficult. People making fundamental analysis are not making money because their analysis is correct. They make money because in long term stock prices go up.

First understand these three terms :

- P&L
- B/S
- Cashflow

Then understand how these terms are connected and how companies can hide something in one statement but it will be visible in other.

For example, companies will do channel stuffing i.e. send stuff to their distributors without taking money but show it as sales (it comes under Revenue Recognition). This boosts P&L and show increased EPS or P/E. But in the balance sheet will show Payables and you can calculate Days Payables to see what they are doing. This is not true profit just trying to delay the inevitable loss

---

- P&L : Profit and Loss Statement is a financial statement that shows company’s revenues/sales, expenses, and profits/loss over a specific period.
  - 
- B/S : Balancesheet is a financial statement that provides overview of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It consists of 3 main components:
  - Assets : assets like cash, inventory, property, equipment and investments.
  - Liability : represent’s company’s obligation like loan, accounts payable, and bonds.
  - Equity (Shareholder’s Equity) : portion of company owned by shareholders. It is equal to Total Assets - Total Liability
- Cash Flow Statement is a financial statement that records the cash generated and used by a company over a particular period. It is divided into three main sections:
  - **Operating Activities:** Shows the cash flows from the primary business activities, like selling goods or providing services.
  - **Investing Activities:** Illustrates the cash flows from investment-related activities, such as buying or selling assets or investments.
  - **Financing Activities:** Covers the cash flows from financing operations, including raising capital, paying dividends, or issuing stock.

### How these 3 parameters are connected

- **Net Income (P&L) and Equity (B/S):**
  - **Profit or Loss:** Net income increases equity, while a loss decreases it. The net income/loss gets carried over to the B/S and increases or decreases the total equity.
- **Cash (B/S) and Cash Flow Statement:**
  - **Cash Position:** The cash balances from the B/S are also reflected in the Cash Flow statement's beginning and ending cash balances. The cash flow statement provides a detailed account of the changes in cash due to various activities, connecting the cash position at the beginning and the end of the period.
- **Working Capital and Operating Activities:**
  - **Working Capital:** The working capital, calculated as current assets minus current liabilities on the B/S, affects the company's operating cash flow in the Cash Flow Statement. The management of working capital impacts the company's ability to generate operational cash flows.
- **Investing and Financing Activities:**
  - **Investment and Financing Decisions:** Investments in assets or divestitures directly impact the balance sheet. The cash flow statement explains the sources and uses of cash due to investing and financing activities, connecting it to the balance sheet items.

These three parameters are connected and should be looked at together.



**Scenario:**

Consider a company that manufactures and sells electronics. Here's how various financial aspects would be reflected in these statements:

1. **P&L Statement:**
   - **Sales Revenue:** The company makes $10 million in sales revenue by selling electronic devices.
   - **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** The cost of manufacturing these devices amounts to $6 million.
   - **Operating Expenses:** It spends $1 million on salaries, utilities, and other operational costs.
   - **Depreciation:** The company depreciates its equipment for $500,000.
2. **Balance Sheet:**
   - Assets:
     - **Accounts Receivable:** The sales generate $8 million in accounts receivable as customers haven't paid the entire amount yet.
     - **Inventory:** The company holds $2 million worth of unsold devices.
     - **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE):** The total PPE is valued at $15 million.
     - **Accumulated Depreciation:** The accumulated depreciation on PPE is $5 million.
   - Liabilities:
     - **Accounts Payable:** It owes suppliers $1 million for materials.
     - **Equity:** The company has a total equity of $20 million, with $3 million in retained earnings.
3. **Cash Flow Statement:**
   - **Operating Activities:** The net cash flow from operations is calculated as ($10M - $6M - $1M - $500K) = $2.5 million.
   - **Investing Activities:** There is a cash outflow of $2 million for purchasing new equipment.
   - **Financing Activities:** No significant financing activities are reported.

**Interconnection:**

- **P&L → Balance Sheet:** Sales revenue from the P&L statement increases accounts receivable. COGS decreases inventory and impacts working capital.
- **Balance Sheet → Cash Flow:** Changes in accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, etc., reflect in the Cash Flow statement under operating activities.
- **P&L → Cash Flow:** Net income from the P&L statement impacts the net cash flow from operating activities in the Cash Flow statement.

These statements are interlinked and reflect the financial health and performance of the company, where the impact on one statement directly influences the others.

## Introduction to Stock Market

### Need to Invest

Everyone worries about what future might hold for them. People invest to secure their future. Investments are useful in old age or a critical time of need.

Value of money depreciates year on year that is know as Inflation. In simpler terms same packet of milk that you have bought for 14 INR two months ago is now 16 INR. It has become more expensive or commodity remained same but the value of money depreciated.

Every investments has different returns which is proportional to risk associated with the investment. We can broadly divide investments in 4 categories.

1. Equity : Highest return and high risks as well. Ex : US Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), etc.
2. Real Estate : Quite good return and little risk, but a huge problem of liquidity and outlay cash required for Investments. Ex : Apartments, Flats and Agricultural Lands.
3. Commodity : little return and negligible risk, very good liquidity. Ex : gold, silver bonds.
4. Fixed Income Instruments : negligible return, effectively losing money. Ex : FDs, Bonds by Govt. or related agencies like HUDCO, NHAI. Corporate bonds.

Amount of risk an individual can take directly depends on their age, At younger age (<30), A person should do high risk investments in his portfolio and should slowly diversify and move his portfolio towards with more safe investments during his retirement.

### Regulators

How do we invest in stock markets ? Who enables, verifies and secures the transactions and the rights of those who are investing in markets ?

Stock Markets are made up by Stock Exchanges. They are Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange. There are other exchanges but they really don’t contribute much in market.

#### Stock Market Participants

- Domestic Retail Participants : These are people like you and me in market.
- NRI’s and OCIs : These are indians but based outside of India
- Domestic Institutions : Large corporate entities based in India like LIC.
- Domestic Asset Management Companies : these are mutual fund companies such as SBI Mutual Funds, DSP Black Rock, Fidelity Investments, HDFC AMCs, etc
- Foreign Institutional Investors : Non-indian corporate entities. For e.g. Foreign AMC, Hedge Funds, or other investors.

**Remember Irrespective of the category of Market Participant, Everyone’s agenda is to make MONEY :P**

When money is involved, human emotion run high in form of greed, fear, persuation and scams. One can easily fall pray to such practices and to ensure the rights of everyone we have SEBI.

**Security and Exchange Board of India** (SEBI), ensure :

- Stock exchanges conducts its business fairly.
- Stock Brockers and sub-brokers conduct business fairly
- Corporate don’t use markets to dully benefit themselves
- Large Investors with huge cash pile should not manipulate markets.
