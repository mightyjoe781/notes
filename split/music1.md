# Music Theory Basics

## A helpful message :)

As a self-taught guitarist I think biggest issues you will face will be having a practice schedule and motivation to work on it. Later sections will talk about some techniques to help you with keep learning.

In my early days of learning music, I regret that I appreciated music without developing a keen sense of what constitutes good or bad music. Perhaps I wasn't naturally gifted with a great sense of music, but I've come to realize that musical perception is relative and can be cultivated through practice. Over time, as I've practiced and listened to the same open chords repeatedly, my brain has instinctively started discerning nuances in those chords.

As you progress on your musical journey, you too will develop a sense of what resonates as good or bad music to you. It's important not to label yourself as tone-deaf or blindly follow guides or influencers. Stay open to experimentation and trust in your evolving musical instincts. With dedication and exploration, your musical understanding will grow richer and more nuanced.

Listen closely to what you play, as even the simplest techniques can evoke deep emotions in people. Music isn't about crafting the most complex symphonies or using the most complicated hand techniques to perform summning jutsu; it's about touching the emotions of others. Experience music rather than merely performing it.

I've expressed this enough, but remember, one of the greatest motivations for playing guitar is the ability to evoke emotion—whether it's joyous or sorrowful, uplifting or contemplative. Let the guitar resonate within you; don't just play it, feel it.

### Module 0

#### How to Tune A Guitar

- Poly-tuner or Snark
- GuitarTuna app
- Tuner/Apps only work if guitar is roughly out of tune or else we might need to listen to sound and tunes while replacing strings.
- Learn how to use your ear to tune a guitar
- Always use one-string at a time ! Look up Rest Stroking in Classical Guitar.

#### How to Hold Your Guitar

- put the guitar on right leg as a beginner, experts use left leg to easy access to higher notes
- use your right rest on the guitar, in case of electric guitar rest the wrist
- guitar is held in place by right hand and leg and back straight
- don’t lean over the guitar ! don’t look at strings.

#### Positive Finger Placement

- first few weeks your finger will hurt
- how much pressure applied on a portion of fret changes the sounds
- to play a note more clearer keep fingers towards end of fret, requires less pressure/pain

#### Reading Guitar Boxes

![image-20230501104821814](mod0.assets/image-20230501104821814.png)

- Let’s take chord D for Example
  - Horizontal Lines : fret
  - Vertical Lines : Strings
  - Dark first Horizontal Line : Nut
  - 1, 2, 3 : which fingers where (T-thumb, 1-index, 2-driving, 3-ring, 4-pinky) [Note in piano : 1-thumb...]
  - X - won’t play that string
  - 0 - play that string openly


#### How to Hold Guitar Pick

- using a pick is helpful while learning strumming pattern and song playing
- use absolute thinnest pick

#### How to Strum Without Pick

### Module 4

#### Beginner Finger Stretches

- difficulty varies according to anatomy
- not a speed exercise but do it slowly and strecthing
- keep your fingers parallel to one another and keep fingers roughly where they should be
- This Is A Finger Stretch Exercise, Not A Finger Pain Exercise
- bar chord : n, n+1, n+2, n+3 fret (probably called spider ig)

#### The Dm Chord

- ![img](mod4.assets/OD-Dm-chord-f4.png)
- Many guitarist use 1-2-3 for the Dm, but for beginner 1-2-4 because 4 helps develop pinky finger
- practice : One Minute Change Exercise & Perfect Chord Exercise

#### [Metronome](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/meet-the-metronome-b1-403)

- enable to play in a steady, consistent rhythm - one of the vital skills for being a great guitarist.
- If you practice with a metronome regularly, you’ll develop your inner sense of rhythm!
- ability to play at a consistent tempo even when the click is off
- Rules :
  1. FIRST RULE : Practice different Tempo
  2. SECOND RULE : Accentuate the beat!
  3. THIRD RULE : Accuracy
- Try this metronome : https://geni.us/jgtr-time

#### [THE Strumming Pattern](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-strumming-pattern-b1-404)

- Step 1 : Start off with a simple pattern of four down-strums per bar. Then, while you strum, you should count aloud – 1, 2, 3, 4…

- Step 2 

- ```
  1 2+ 3+ 4
  
  D DU DU D
  ```

- Step 3

- ```
  1 2+ + 4
  
  D Du u D
  ```

- 80-100 BPM on metronome is a good idea

### Preface

Following this guide should be used as a reference for experienced players and a good starting point for beginners. Although this guide seems like a comprehensive list of multiple topics, it barely scratches the surface of the iceberg of music.

If you can master most of the basic topics here, that should ideally put you ahead of 70% of guitarists. This guide essentially tries to encompass my journey into music and serves as a reference notebook for me.

To err is human, and I humbly acknowledge that this music guide might contain some imperfections. I kindly ask you to appreciate the effort put into this resource and report any mistakes or suggestions to my repository. Thank you for your support, and happy playing!

PS: I do love to talk about music, so you might find a lot of content where I'm talking to myself :)
